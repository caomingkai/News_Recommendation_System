Tried resting, rehabbing, to try and get myself ready here.\n\n\"I was actually practising OK the last few days.\"\n\nAsked if he had risked potential further damage by attempting to play at Flushing Meadows, Murray added: \"I certainly wouldn't have been hurting myself more by trying to play. It was more a question of whether it would settle down in time.\n\n\"Obviously I kind of ran out of time. Maybe if I'd been able to take a little bit more time off.\"\n\nMurray joins last year's finalists Wawrinka and Novak Djokovic - both of whom have chosen to end their seasons because of injuries - in a lengthy list of absentees in New York, but he hopes to return to action in 2018.\n\nCroatian fifth seed Marin Cilic will move up to Murray's place in the draw and face Sandgren in the first round on Monday.\n\nMurray practised in New York all week in an attempt to be fit for the tournament\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent at Flushing Meadows:\n\nA slight limp was still visible when Murray took to the practice court on Saturday lunchtime. He was striking the ball well against Lucas Pouille and looked in better shape than he had done at the same stage before Wimbledon, but there was a zip and intensity missing from the session - for good reason, as it now appears.\n\nPerhaps Murray could have made this decision 10 days ago before flying to New York to step up his preparations, but better late than never. There is no point in him playing an event he has virtually no chance of winning, however open the draw may seem.\n\nHaving already consulted a range of specialists, Murray sounded quite sure he would be able to decide on his next move over the next couple of days. He did not address the need for surgery, but surely it remains an option, and perhaps we will not see him again this year.\n\nWhatever the plan, Murray's focus must now be entirely on 2018. He will not win Grand Slams if he is only 80% fit, and unable to move with the speed and purpose which have brought him so much success thus far.\n\nBecker's Wimbledon warning plays out\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Archive: What next for Murray?\n\nFollowing Murray's Wimbledon exit in July, BBC Sport pundit and six-time Grand Slam winner Boris Becker advised Murray to consider skipping the US Open.\n\n\"Age is only a number, but you only have one body. Andy has to look after his,\" said Becker.\n\n\"He has got to think long term, not worry about making the US Open - if he is moving there like he did at Wimbledon, then he won't win it anyway.\n\n\"So, the worst thing that can happen if he skips New York is that he misses one Grand Slam - that doesn't matter, because the Australian Open is around the corner at the start of 2018.\"\n\nBecker said Murray could learn from Nadal and Roger Federer, both of whom took long breaks from the game before returning fitter.\n\nNadal pulled out of the French Open in May 2016 with a wrist injury and did not play again until the Rio Olympics in August. He won his 10th title at Roland Garros earlier this year.\n\nFederer missed the final five months of 2016 to recover from his knee injury but returned to win the Australian Open in January and Wimbledon in July.\n\n\"With this injury, there are limitations to Andy's movement,\" said Becker. \"Andy relies on his speed and footwork, which are an integral part of his game.\n\n\"That is why he needs to be 100% fit. It's no good for him to be 75%.\"","author":"BBC Sport","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T20:10:20.000Z"},"source":"bbc-news","urlToImage":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/107B2/production/_97560576_andy_murray_getty1.jpg","digest":"MxPKrWw4B82Ya7wgeEheMA==\n"}

So how was she able to leave the country just hours before the verdict was due to be read out? Immigration authorities say they have no record of her leaving the country.\n\nHowever, it is a poorly-concealed secret that some in the military government would have been happy to see her leave the country before the verdict.\n\nHad she been convicted and jailed, she could have been seen as a victim by her supporters. The government was nervous about their reaction. Acquitting her, though, would have been equally unacceptable to her hard-line opponents, many of them very influential.\n\nThat would also have undermined the justification for the military coup which overthrew her government. So it is unlikely anyone tried to stop her leaving, or that they will try to get her back.\n\nWhat happened in court?\n\nMs Yingluck's lawyer had requested a delay in the ruling, telling the Supreme Court that she had vertigo and a severe headache and was unable to attend.\n\nBut the court said in a statement that it did not believe she was sick as there was no medical certificate, and that the alleged sickness was not severe enough to prevent her travelling to court.\n\n\"Such behaviour convincingly shows that she is a flight risk. As a result, the court has issued an arrest warrant and confiscated the posted bail money,\" the statement said.\n\nMs Yingluck posted $900,000 (£703,000) bail at the beginning of her trial.\n\nImage caption Journalists waited outside Ms Yingluck's home in Bangkok, expecting her to attend the court\n\nFriday's turn of events took many by surprise, including the hundreds of people who turned up outside the Supreme Court in Bangkok to support Ms Yingluck.\n\nWhat is the trial about?\n\nMs Yingluck, who became Thailand's first female prime minister in 2011, was impeached in 2015 over the rice scheme by a military-backed legislature, which then brought the legal case.\n\nThe scheme, part of Ms Yingluck's election campaign platform, was launched shortly after she took office.\n\nIt was aimed at boosting farmers' incomes and alleviating rural poverty, and saw the government paying farmers nearly twice the market rate for their crop.\n\nBut it hit Thailand's rice exports hard, leading to a loss of at least $8bn and huge stockpiles of rice which the government could not sell.\n\nThough it was popular with her rural voter base, opponents said the scheme was too expensive and open to corruption.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Hundreds of Ms Yingluck's supporters had gathered outside the court on Friday\n\nDuring her trial, Ms Yingluck had argued she was not responsible for the day-to-day running of the scheme. She has insisted she is a victim of political persecution.\n\nHow popular is Yingluck Shinawatra?\n\nHer time in office was overshadowed by controversy as well as strong political opposition.\n\nThe youngest sister of Mr Thaksin, she was seen by her opponents as a proxy for her brother, who was controversially ousted by the military in 2006.\n\nBoth siblings remain popular among the rural poor, but are hated by an urban and middle-class elite.\n\nTheir Puea Thai party has - under various different names - won every election in Thailand since 2001.\n\nTimeline of Yingluck's rice scheme controversy\n\nMay 2011- Yingluck Shinawatra is elected PM, and shortly afterwards begins rolling out her rice subsidy scheme\n\nJanuary 2014 - Thailand's anti-corruption authorities investigate Ms Yingluck in connection to the scheme\n\nMay 2014 - She is forced to step down from her post after Thailand's constitutional court finds her guilty of abuse of power in another case.

England fly-half Katy McLean, with a three-woman overlap outside her, decided instead to kick from just inside her own half.\n\nThe Black Ferns had players back for just such a decision and they mounted a surging, multi-phase counter-attack which ended a minute later with Natua bundling over, and the momentum of the game had changed irreversibly.\n\nNew Zealand stamp their authority\n\nEngland tried to go toe-to-toe with the Black Ferns and they twice regained the lead, the second time courtesy of Thompson as she scorched down the wing, leaving the tournament's leading try scorer Portia Woodman floundering in her wake.\n\nBut, in the 15 minutes that followed England going back in front 25-24, New Zealand - who had 80% possession in the second half - blew the Red Roses away.\n\nNatua went over to complete her hat-trick - the television match official happy she had released and regathered rather than knocking-on - Cocksedge sniped over and Carla Hohepa handed Winiata her second on a plate after another pin-point Subritzky-Nafatali cross-kick.\n\nEngland's defence had been demolished and although they rallied to score the final try of a high-class match, there was no doubt that New Zealand are the best side in the world and deserving world champions.\n\nEngland's Emily Scarratt was swarmed by the Black Ferns defence every time she received the ball\n\nDefeat 'bitterly disappointing'\n\nEngland's Emily Scarratt, speaking to BBC Radio 5 live: \"It is unbelievably tough to take. When you come with one goal and get yourself into a position to achieve that, it is bitterly disappointing.\n\n\"We played some good rugby in that first half but it's hard to play well if you don't have the ball. We will come again in four years time. Fair play to New Zealand, they executed their plan better than we did ours.\"\n\nEngland coach Simon Middleton, speaking to BBC Radio 5 live: \"It is a disappointment. We came here to win. We just could not get possession. They played a really smart game. When we did get the ball they had a massive physical presence, they are so good at playing that short game, that was the story of the second half.\n\n\"We did react, but we literally couldn't stop them. They were very efficient at keeping the ball. Full credit to them. When you get two great teams together, one is always going to come out on the wrong side.\"\n\nWorld Cup final teams\n\nEngland: Emily Scarratt; Lydia Thompson, Megan Jones, Rachel Burford, Kay Wilson; Katy Mclean, Natasha Hunt; Vickii Cornborough, Amy Cokayne, Sarah Bern, Abbie Scott, Tamara Taylor, Alex Matthews, Marlie Packer, Sarah Hunter (capt).\n\nReplacements: Vicky Fleetwood, Rochelle Clark, Justine Lucas, Harriet Millar-Mills, Izzy Noel-Smith, La Toya Mason, Amber Reed, Amy Wilson Hardy\n\nNew Zealand: Selica Winiata; Portia Woodman, Stacey Waaka, Kelly Brazier, Renee Wickliffe; Victoria Subritzky-Nafatali, Kendra Cocksedge; Toka Natua, Fiao'o Faamausili (capt), Aldora Itunu, Eloise Blackwell, Charmaine Smith, Charmaine McMenamin, Sarah Goss, Aroha Savage.\n\nReplacements: Te Kura Ngata-Aerengamate, Sosoli Talawadua, Aleisha Nelson, Rebecca Wood, Lesley Ketu,Kristina Sue, Theresa Fitzpatrick, Carla Hohepa","author":"BBC Sport","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T20:35:59.000Z"},"source":"bbc-sport","urlToImage":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/B73A/production/_97560964_hunterpa.jpg","digest":"Zv7Zd2rAA/MNHfzeW2QDmw==\n"}

He does not charm you but fights furiously and knows his game,\" Marks added.\n\n\"It was a critical 134 that has restored West Indian pride and has got them controlling this game.\"\n\nEngland punished after good start\n\nEngland would have been confident of a first-innings lead when Anderson took his 494th and 495th Test wickets within the first nine overs of the day.\n\nHe dismissed nightwatchman Devendra Bishoo and Kyle Hope - the latter falling to an excellent catch from England captain Joe Root - in a brilliant spell of six overs, three maidens, two wickets for five runs.\n\nThe hosts were unfortunate in the morning session as they beat the bat on a number of occasions but in the afternoon session they conceded 97 runs and failed to create many serious chances.\n\nBroad was wayward while Chris Woakes, playing his first international match since June following a side injury, looked short of match practice.\n\nThe dismissals in the final hour of Brathwaite and Roston Chase will lift England a little, but their day was summed up when the final ball of the day, a horrid half-tracker from off-spinner Moeen, was swatted for four by Jermaine Blackwood.\n\nAt times, Anderson aside, England bowled too short while former captain Michael Vaughan said the edges failed to carry to the slips because of the speed of the England bowling.\n\n\"The pace was around 81mph,\" Vaughan said. \"The reason you have four seamers in the team is because you can up the pace. If it means you bowl one less over then you do so.\n\n\"In the winter against Australia, England will be in situations like this. They will not have it all their own way and they will have to fight and come from behind. This is the perfect practice.\"\n\n'Good to get the monkey off my back' - reaction\n\nEngland seamer James Anderson: \"It was a frustrating day. We started very well when conditions were in our favour but then when the sun came out the pitch got slower.\n\n\"We bowled well in patches but didn't do that consistently enough. There were too many balls to release the pressure.\n\n\"If we can limit them to a 100-125 run lead and then bat well, that puts us in with a good chance of winning the game because the pitch is spinning.\"\n\nWest Indies batsman Shai Hope, speaking to Sky Sports: \"It was good to get the monkey off my back. I felt the pressure. As a professional you want to perform to your best. I wasn't thinking about the 100 as much as I would expect [when in the 90s].\n\n\"I just tried to bat as long as possible and stick it out. The key word for us was fight.

Leicester were once again on the back foot in their area before Anthony Martial struck a shot that came off Danny Simpson's arm. Referee Michael Oliver declared it to be deliberate handball.\n\nLatest Premier League reports ...plus reaction \u0026 video here\n\nLukaku stepped up to the spot, but his hopes of a fourth league goal this season were thwarted by Schmeichel's dive to the right.\n\nLeicester continued to come under pressure and eventually succumbed when Rashford's instinctive shot flew past the Dane in goal in the 70th minute.\n\nHoles now began to appear in Leicester's previously watertight defence as they went looking for an equaliser.\n\nUnited capitalised again as substitute Lingard's low drive was diverted into the net by Fellaini, although replays suggested the Belgian was fractionally offside.\n\nFoxes lacked bite\n\nLeicester striker Jamie Vardy has been linked with a move to Chelsea\n\nLeicester manager Craig Shakespeare should not be too despondent.\n\nHis side's valiant defensive display was reminiscent of those during the Premier League-winning campaign two seasons ago. It was at the other end that his men disappointed.\n\nAt Old Trafford, both Jamie Vardy - the Foxes' star striker of 2015-16 - and Shinji Okazaki were ineffective, while Riyad Mahrez teased the United defence without an end product.\n\nVardy was withdrawn with 15 minutes left, to be replaced by Islam Slimani.\n\nThe closest Leicester came to scoring was when substitute Andy King forced a brilliant point-blank save from David de Gea in the final few seconds of the match.\n\nMan of the match - Harry Maguire (Leicester)\n\nIt is not often you make a player on the losing side your man of the match, but Harry Maguire was exceptional at the back for Leicester. The man mountain made 10 clearances and four interceptions during the game to frustrate United.\n\n'Nine points after three matches is nothing different' - reaction\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Players committed to Man Utd cause - Mourinho\n\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho on winning the first three matches: \"We can look into perspective. Last season we won against Leicester at home so that doesn't make a difference, but we had too many draws at home last season.\n\n\"The difference is the quality of our football, we're playing better today. If we hadn't won this match I wouldn't have anyone to blame.\n\nThe team is playing very well and I'm very confident. We are comfortable on the ball and dangerous on the counter-attack. But nine points after three matches is nothing different for us, because we did that last season.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Shakespeare vows to work on Leicester defending\n\nLeicester boss Craig Shakespeare: \"I think we frustrated them for large parts of the game. When you come to Old Trafford in the form they are in, they will have big moments. We had our moments too, but could not see the game through.\n\n\"Set-pieces are our Achilles heel at the moment. We need to organise better.\n\n\"It was a harsh penalty, but a great save form Schmeichel. To go 1-0 down, it knocked a bit of spirit from us. I'm disappointed in the overall result, but we were nice and solid for large parts.\n\n\"You have to be disciplined; you know what the opposition's strengths are. We tried to attack in the second half.\n\n\"Maguire was carrying a knock but was desperate to play - he was solid.\"\n\nNew Man Utd penalty taker needed?\n\nManchester United have kept a clean sheet in their opening three league games of a season for the sixth time in their history and fourth in the Premier League era.\n\nHowever, the Red Devils failed to win the title in those previous five campaigns (1927-28, 1991-92, 1997-98, 2005-06, and 2015-16).\n\nManchester United will spend their 14th night at the top of the Premier League table in 2017-18 - the same number as in 2015-16 and 2016-17 combined (14).\n\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan equalled the Premier League record for most assists in his first three apps in a season (five by Ruel Fox in 1994-95).\n\nRomelu Lukaku has missed two of his last three penalties taken in the Premier League.\n\nSeven of Marcus Rashford's 11 Premier League goals have come at Old Trafford (64%).\n\nWhat's next?\n\nUnited are at Stoke on Saturday, 9 September (17:30 BST) when the Premier League resumes after the international break.

as well as the part he played with his kicking from hand in all three Hull tries.\n\nHull kickstarted by Sneyd\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Challenge Cup win a dream come true - Hull FC's Marc Sneyd\n\nThe role of the kicker in any game of rugby league is crucial - and never more so than here.\n\nWigan got off to a great start when Hull allowed Thomas Leuluai's hopeful high kick to bounce, which it did horribly, spearing itself into the grateful clutches of centre Anthony Gelling who passed inside for Bateman to score.\n\nBut Sneyd was about to take control, abetted massively by half-back partner Albert Kelly.\n\nWhen Wigan failed to prevent the slippery Kelly offloading on a last tackle, Sneyd hoisted a high one and Talanoa easily outjumped Liam Marshall to score.\n\nThen, on 20 minutes, what looked a routine Sneyd high kick to the right caused an unexpected level of havoc - and Hull even had another man spare outside him as Fonua picked up to score.\n\nLeuluai and Williams linked beautifully to send Gildart over at the left corner on 32 minutes but Williams missed from the left touchline.\n\nHaving led 12-10 at the break, it was then Sneyd's 40-20 kick into the left corner that built the attacking base which allowed Kelly, with a low pass, to get Fonua in at the right corner.\n\nAnd, although Burgess halved the deficit from eight to four points, Williams missed again from wide out on the left - and that was the way it stayed to hand Wigan their first defeat at the new Wembley.\n\nExperience counts at Wembley\n\nMahe Fonua is in his last season with Hull FC, as he is set to return to Australia at the end of the campaign\n\nIn three previous Challenge Cup final meetings between these two, Wigan had won them all - most recently the 16-0 success for the Cherry and Whites in 2013.\n\nWigan's record 19 Challenge Cup wins, compared to Hull's four prior to this game, also looked a weighty statistic to hang round black and white necks.\n\nBut experience on the park is what counts for most.\n\nEight of Wigan's starting line-up, as well as all four replacements, were making their Wembley debuts - including late replacement Marshall, who did not have the happiest of afternoons on the right wing after coming in when Tom Davies failed a late fitness test on his ankle injury.\n\nIn contrast, only one of Hull's 17, Jake Connor, was not involved when they edged Warrington 12-10 in just as gripping a contest in 2016.\n\nNot only did Lee Radford's men already know what winning at Wembley is all about, they had lost here too - and, in skipper Gareth Ellis's final season, came with a fierce determination to make amends for 2013.\n\nOne downside was the attendance of 68,525 - by some distance the lowest since the Challenge Cup final returned to the rebuilt Wembley in 2007.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Mahe Fonua: Hull FC winger's two Challenge Cup tries 'icing on cake'\n\nWhat's next?\n\nWigan went into the Challenge Cup final on the back of successive Super League home wins over Huddersfield and Salford, but the trip to Wembley marked the start of a tough run-in mostly spent on the road as they bid to retain their league title.\n\nThree of their final four games are away from home, starting with the local derby at St Helens on Friday and followed by a rematch with Hull seven days later.\n\nThe one home game they have left is against League Leaders' Shield winners Castleford, before they round off their league programme at fourth-placed Wakefield.\n\nThird-placed Hull, three places higher than Wigan in the Super League table, will be back in action on Thursday at Leeds.\n\nAfter the home game against Wigan, they also host Wakefield before finishing at Castleford.\n\nHull FC have won back-to-back Challenge Cup finals at Wembley, having previously failed to win eight deciders at the venue\n\nIt was the second time in four years that Hull FC and Wigan met in a Challenge Cup final\n\nHull FC: Shaul; Fonua, Griffin, Tuimavave, Talanoa; Kelly, Sneyd; Watts, Houghton, Taylor, Manu, Minichiello, Ellis.\n\nInterchanges: Green, Washbrook, Bowden, Connor.\n\nWigan Warriors: Tomkins; Davies, Gelling, Gildart, Burgess; Williams, Leuluai; Nuuausala, McIlorum, Clubb, Bateman, Farrell, O'Loughlin.\n\nInterchanges: Isa, Sutton, Powell, Tautai.\n\nReferee: Phil Bentham","author":"BBC Sport","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T17:06:46.000Z"},"source":"bbc-sport","urlToImage":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/10C39/production/_97556686_hull_rex.jpg","digest":"v2j4SFV3syy8jIN/79NgwQ==\n"}

Photographer: Alex Scott/Bloomberg\n\nHarvey smashed ashore as a Category 4 hurricane Friday near Rockport, Texas, a town left devastated. It was the strongest storm to hit the U.S. since 2004 and broke a 12-year record span in which the nation avoided being hit by a system ranked Category 3 or higher on the five-step Saffir Simpson scale. Since making landfall, Harvey has been downgraded to a tropical storm and come to a near-standstill over the town of Victoria.\n\nThe storm may spur $1.59 billion in damages, according to catastrophe model results from Kinetic Analysis Corp., which said insured losses may be $1.11 billion.\n\n“This will shift away from a wind concern and more into a flood concern,” said Dan Pydynowski, a meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania. “The heavy rain and flood threat will continue right into the middle of next week; we could still be talking about this thing by Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of next week.”\n\nThe storm is striking a region that has a cluster of refineries that process 5 million barrels of oil a day. About 1 million barrels a day of crude and condensate refining capacity in Texas have been shut by companies including Valero Energy Corp., according to company statements, government releases and people familiar with the situation. About 24 percent of Gulf of Mexico oil production had also been shuttered, along with the port of Corpus Christi, which ships the largest amount of U.S. crude overseas.\n\nIn addition to the energy threat, crops and livestock may struggle to cope with rising waters, while airlines have canceled flights at multiple Texas airports. Because of where the storm has stalled, the Houston area could be in for days of torrential downpours and tornadoes.\n\nTexas A\u0026M University’s AgriLife Extension Service is helping to set up animal sheltering sites around the state in case ranchers need to relocate cattle or other animals, said Andy Vestal, a professor and extension specialist. Some livestock owners that are closest to the coast have already been working to move animals to higher ground, away from low-lying areas and tributaries, he said.\n\n“We’ve never experienced 20 to 30 inches of rainfall in a 48-hour period,” Vestal said by phone from College Station, Texas.\n\nAt least 100 modules storing cotton blew away in the Gregory area, said farmer Jeff McKamey, who owns a cotton gin that suffered minor damage when part of the piping and roof blew away. A storage tank containing sorghum at a local grain elevator in the town of Odem is completely gone and at least three other sorghum tanks collapsed at an elevator between Taft and Gregory, he said.\n\n“We’ve had the most cotton ever in storage in the history of San Patricio County when the hurricane hit,” said McKamey, noting some cotton in the remaining storage modules may be too wet to process. “It’s just the worst possible time.”\n\nAt least 780 inbound and outbound flights were canceled at Houston’s two airports Saturday, with another 187 in Austin, San Antonio and Dallas, according to Houston-based FlightAware, an airline tracking service. Close to 400 flights in and out of Texas for Sunday were also scrubbed. At least 254,785 customers had lost power across the state, according to a Bloomberg survey of electric utility outage maps. The hardest-hit region, with about 200,000 knocked out, was from Brownsville to Bay City, served by a unit of American Electric Power Co.\n\nPower lines sit collapsed on a street in Rockport, Texas.

It is going to have a tremendous impact on businesses, homes, property and the ability to travel in the entire Houston area.”\n\nAs of 9 a.m. local time, Houston Southwest Airport had received 6.4 inches of rain, according to the U.S. Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. From 15 to 30 inches of rain is forecast across the entire region, with some areas getting as much as 40 inches, the hurricane center said.\n\nWhite Oak Bayou in Houston climbed nearly 16 feet since Friday and was forecast to rise another 25 feet by Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. The Buffalo Bayou at Piney Point Village, just west of central Houston, is forecast to set a record, while the waterway is expected to rise by more than 30 feet near Shepherd Drive in the city itself.\n\nHarvey had maximum sustained winds of 70 miles (113 kilometers) per hour, the hurricane center said in an advisory at 1 p.m. local time.\n\nThe current track forecast shows the storm meandering around southeastern Texas gradually weakening to a tropical depression early next week. While the track means heavy rains will fall unabated, there is a glimmer of good news in the forecast if it holds -- Harvey won’t drift into the Gulf and restrengthen.\n\n“It still might re-intensify to a Category 1 again later this week, but the nightmare scenario of another Category 3 landfall looks highly unlikely now,” said Todd Crawford, chief meteorologist at The Weather Company in Andover, Massachusetts. “The big story going forward will be the epic amounts of rainfall in a large area.”\n\nIn addition to Harvey, hurricane center forecasters are watching a low pressure system over Florida that could develop into a tropical or sub-tropical storm early next week. The system will likely be short lived, but could bring heavy rain to Florida.\n\nCategory 4\n\nIn addition to its economic impact, Harvey prompted thousands of residents along the Texas coast to flee their homes and caused Governor Greg Abbott to declare an emergency. It was the first Category 4 storm to hit Texas since 1961 and the first to hit the U.S. since 2004. Katrina, the most costly hurricane in U.S. history, came ashore as a Category 3 storm in 2005.\n\nThe Marathon Texas City Refinery as roads flood in Texas City.

Gasoline futures settled at a three-week high Friday as the storm approached.\n\nPresident Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration, making federal assistance available to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency waived certain fuel requirements for gasoline and diesel in eastern parts of the state to allay concerns of fuel shortages.\n\n— With assistance by Christine Buurma, Amy Stillman, Sheela Tobben, Naureen S Malik, Barbara J Powell, Mary Schlangenstein, Sonali Basak, Ryan Collins, Laura Blewitt, Jim Polson, Alex Tribou, Alex Longley, David Wethe, Jessica Summers, Jen Skerritt, Catherine Traywick, Sophie Caronello, Tim Loh, Dan Murtaugh, Abigail Morris, and Mark Chediak","author":"Brian K Sullivan, Jen Skerritt","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T10:37:50.922Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i4chGkqxxCIY/v0/1200x675.jpg","digest":"ky/eTcB838mJMjz8xfekQg==\n"}

Early on, it was the high-powered promoters and executives who failed to accurately assess his earning potential. Money Mayweather still hasn’t forgotten.\n\nFor the last bout of his career, Mayweather is avenging the perceived slights he suffered at the beginning of his illustrious career. Renowned as a fiendishly driven gambler, the greatest bet Mayweather placed was the $750,000 he laid down on himself in 2006, when he rejected an $8 million contract for a fight and bought out his contract with Top Rank in order to promote himself. Though his opponent this weekend will be MMA star Conor McGregor, a welcome ancillary target for Mayweather is HBO.\n\nWith no real challengers remaining in boxing this year, Mayweather turned to the UFC and its biggest star, Conor McGregor. According to insiders, he timed the announcement and staged the fight in a manner designed to deal maximum damage to his former network partner, HBO, and two of their biggest pay-per-view fights of 2017.\n\nBegin with the choice of an Aug. 26 fight date. “It’s perverse,” says Jim Lampley, HBO boxing’s longtime commentator, from his home in San Diego. “If there’s one indelible, accepted principle in operating pay-per-view, it’s ‘never before Labor Day.’\n\nMayweather at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center on July 13. Photographer: Mike Lawrie/Getty Images North America\n\nThat’s why, for the upcoming HBO bout between middleweight titleholder Gennady Golovkin and former champ Canelo Alvarez—one of boxing’s best tilts, on paper, in years—the channel jumped on Sept. 16 to maximize the number of pay-per-view buys, assuming that Showtime would choose a later date in the fall for Mayweather-McGregor.\n\nInstead, Mayweather-McGregor was set for Aug. 26, creating a tidal wave of publicity that is currently drowning the lead-up to the Canelo-Golovkin fight. To rub salt in HBO’s wound, Mayweather announced his fight against McGregor on June 14, three days before Andre Ward, an HBO world champion fighter who inherited the pound-for-pound crown from Floyd, fought a rematch against Sergey Kovalev. In 30 years of pay-per-view TV, only two fights performed worse than Ward-Kovalev II. Mayweather’s announcement didn’t help those numbers.\n\nStephen Espinoza, executive vice president of Showtime Sports, has said in previous interviews that the match came together quickly and that the fighters simply didn’t want to wait until November to rumble. (Sources at Showtime were unavailable to speak on the record at press time.) Among media watchers, the idea that the last weekend in August was an “open runway,” with no sports competition, could have made it an irresistible, if counterintuitive, target date.\n\nThat is small comfort to the folks at HBO. “Everybody in boxing is doing the best they can, without being overwhelmingly defensive, to make the point that there’s a great fight coming up,” Lampley continued. “But it’s not on Aug. 26. It’s on Sept. 16.”\n\nA ‘Slave Contract’\n\nMayweather’s beef with HBO goes back to 1997. Lou Dibella, then an executive at HBO, remembers how the brash 20-year-old, then-126-pound Floyd Mayweather Jr. responded to the contract offer Dibella had just pushed across the table. It would guarantee Mayweather seven figures each for a series of fights. In Dibella’s telling, Mayweather glanced up in disgust. “This is a slave contract,” the fighter said.\n\nTrue, Mayweather had emerged the year before as a blue chip prospect, an Olympic bronze medalist from the Atlanta Olympic Games who hailed from one of the most accomplished boxing families in the sport. But he had yet to find a fan base or demonstrate any ability to sell tickets—let alone pay-per-view shows.\n\nMayweather and UFC lightweight champion Conor McGregor face off during a news conference at the MGM Grand Hotel \u0026 Casino in Las Vegas. Photographer: Ethan Miller/Getty Images North America\n\nMayweather had fought and won 12 times in the previous year, but his defensive, counterpunching style didn’t stir the kind of excitement boxing fans craved in the wrecking ball era of Mike Tyson. Nor was there any indication that Mayweather’s star power would ever compete with that of boxing’s undefeated “Golden Boy,” Oscar De La Hoya, second only to Tyson.\n\nNot only had De La Hoya, an Olympic gold medalist, owned world titles in four weight classes, he had just defeated a Hall of Fame legend in Pernell Whitaker. With boxing’s audience trending heavily toward Latino demographics, Mayweather’s risk-averse fighting style was widely recognized as anathema to those markets that prioritized action and excitement over technical chess matches, no matter how sublime, in the ring.\n\nThe $750,000 Bet\n\nMayweather eventually signed, but as soon as he had the leverage to leave, his started his own production in 2006. He wanted HBO to guarantee him $20 million to fight De La Hoya, and the network refused. So he paid $750,000 to get out of the deal, and if he couldn’t sell pay-per-view buys on his own name, he would ruthlessly stalk those who could.\n\nHe landed his first self-produced fight on June 25, 2005, against boxing fan-favorite Arturo Gatti, whom Mayweather publicly chided as a “club fighter.” He promptly disposed of Gatti with such ease, “club fighter” seemed a charitable designation. After winning two more pay-per-view fights, Mayweather lured De La Hoya into a dream match on May 5, 2007; it became the most lucrative fight in the history of the sport, generating 2.4 million pay-per-view buys. Two years after HBO had refused to give him $20 million to fight De La Hoya, Mayweather had arranged it on his own—and made $25 million.\n\nWrestlers MVP and Mark Henry join boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. at the end of a tag team match during the WWE Monday Night Raw show in 2009. Photographer: Ethan Miller/Getty Images North America\n\nFrom there, he made another calculation that none of his detractors could see for themselves. If Mayweather could never sell tickets or pay-per-views with fans cheering him on to win, he would sell even better by enticing the public to pay for the opportunity to watch him lose. “Pretty Boy” Floyd Mayweather Jr. transformed into “Money Mayweather.” He gained exposure on the WWE and Dancing with the Stars.\n\nHe fought 11 more times on pay-per-view, generating over $1.3 billion in pay-per-view revenue that helped make him the highest-paid athlete in sports. Of boxing’s five highest-grossing pay-per-view fights, Mayweather owns the top three. If his upcoming bout against McGregor brings in an audience of 50 million people as expected, he will have produced the three biggest pay-per-view events of all time in the past two years.\n\nA New Model?\n\nMayweather’s opponent in the ring, Conor McGregor, is expected to earn as much as $100 million, win or lose. (Mayweather’s cut is anticipated to be at least twice that.) All evidence points to the fact that McGregor is preparing to emulate the 40-year-old’s business model.\n\nAnd McGregor doesn’t appear to be eager to join the HBO fold either. In 2014, he took a break from training in Las Vegas to watch the rematch between Mayweather and Marcos Maidana. That was a year after Mayweather turned his back on a highly lucrative HBO offer and signed a six-fight, $250 million deal with Showtime that effectively anointed the network as boxing’s premium brand.“He stole my blueprint and ran with it,” Mayweather said of McGregor during a session at his gym on Aug. 10.\n\nMayweather exchanges punches with Manny Pacquiao during their welterweight unification championship bout in 2015. Photographer: JOHN GURZINSKI/AFP\n\nThat contract had essentially shut the door on any possibility for a Mayweather-Pacquiao mega-fight, which for four years had been the biggest fight available. But once Manny Pacquiao, boxing’s second-biggest star after Mayweather, lost by one of the most iconic knockouts of the decade to Juan Manuel Marquez, Mayweather had the leverage. He chose to calcify the Cold War-type dynamic between Showtime and HBO even further by fighting only on the lucrative dates available for pay-per-view, daring HBO to compete against him.\n\n\n\nIt seems that there’s never enough for Mayweather. Even for a fight that is largely being dismissed as a pocket-lining scheme, he’ll still earn more in a night than anyone in the history of sports. The fight itself will likely generate more than $500 million in pay-per-view revenue. The gate will reach nearly $100 million, toppling the previous record of $72.2 million for the Pacquiao fight.\n\nInternational broadcast rights could bring in upward of another $100 million. Tens of millions in additional sponsor dollars are readily available. Yet Mayweather still needs others to fail. “I don’t know how far back you have to go to find a fight so guaranteed to generate combustion,” Jim Lampley said with exasperation of his September Canelo-Golovkin fight. “You almost never see matchups this good. A can’t-miss fight. But that all played into making it too great a target for the Mayweather-McGregor attraction to resist.”\n\nThe last time Mayweather lost was in 1996, in a highly controversial decision at the semi-finals of the Atlanta Olympic Games, to Bulgarian Serafim Todorov. Even the Egyptian referee for the bout assumed Mayweather had won the bout and held Mayweather’s hand aloft just as Todorov was announced as the winner. It would seem a mistake to bet against him now.\n\nLou Dibella still goes back to that meeting 20 years ago. “I was born five years after Rocky Marciano knocked out Archie Moore and retired undefeated,” he says. “Look at all the great fighters who came after Marciano. How many from all those great fighters walked away undefeated? Only one of them did. Mayweather, that cocky kid in my office who promised he would, actually pulled it off. He’s the only one in my lifetime who did it.”","author":"Brin-Jonathan Butler","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-25T12:37:14.302Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iyRZfX8CCpTE/v0/1200x895.jpg","digest":"/hFq57pXArNA7f28JVmBOA==\n"}

Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\n\nThat warning followed earlier remarks by Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who offered a broad defense of the steps taken since the 2008 financial-market meltdown and urged that any rollback of post-crisis rules be “ modest.”\n\nThe combined effect was “a subtle shot across the bow of those who seek deregulation,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital Inc. in New York.\n\nThe complementary speeches come at what may be the tail end of Yellen’s tenure at the Fed’s helm. President Donald Trump is not expected to reappoint her when her leadership term expires in February, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\nDifferent Agenda\n\nGapen said that by delivering overlapping messages, Yellen and Draghi could help amplify their points, but “in practice that’s not the agenda the Trump administration is likely to seek.”\n\nIn a talk aimed broadly at defending the merits of globalization, Draghi said it’s crucial to make sure open policies on trade and global finance should be safeguarded with regulations designed to make globalization fair, safe and equitable.\n\n“We have only recently witnessed the dangers of financial openness combined with insufficient regulation,” Draghi said, referring to the global financial crisis of 2008-09.\n\nAny reversal of the regulatory response to that crisis, he added, “would call into question whether the lessons of the crisis have indeed been learnt -- and thus whether financial integration can still be considered safe.”\n\nThat point was all the more important given that central banks are continuing to provide stimulus to their economies. “With monetary policy globally very expansionary, regulators should be wary of rekindling the incentives that led to the crisis,” Draghi said.","author":"Alessandro Speciale, Christopher Condon","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-25T20:46:46.414Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iY_Z6aAw49FQ/v0/1200x800.jpg","digest":"j/oJCFO1dimIZ4rnndjNjw==\n"}

Auerbach and Yuriy Gorodnichenko wrote in a paper they’ll present Saturday at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\nAlan Auerbach in Jackson Hole on Aug. 25. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\n\nThe findings will add to debate over how Congress should respond if the U.S., as expected, tumble into another downturn before the Federal Reserve has had time to lift interest rates to historically normal levels of 4 percent to 5 percent. With its benchmark rate just above 1 percent, the Fed has little room to cut in the next recession, and it may face objections from some Republicans in Congress if it turns again to bond purchases to depress long-term borrowing rates.\n\nThat puts the burden on lawmakers to respond with emergency government spending to soften the blow. But some may balk, the authors note, when they consider that debt-to-GDP already lies at 77 percent for the U.S.\n\nThat would be a mistake, they argue.\n\n“A fiscal stimulus in a weak economy may help improve fiscal sustainability along the metrics we study,” they write. “There is evidence that this effect is undercut when the debt-to-GDP ratio is elevated, although the penalty for a high debt-to-GDP ratio does not appear to be high at the debt levels experienced historically for developed countries.”\n\nThe paper bolsters work by former Treasury Secretary Laurence Summers and another U.C. Berkeley professor, J. Bradford DeLong, who’ve argued that fiscal injections during a recession won’t raise debt-to-GDP levels.\n\nThe research also examined the likely impact of fiscal stimulus on short-term borrowing costs for governments. While the series of data they examined doesn’t go back far enough for a firm conclusion, they wrote, it does suggest that emergency spending in a downturn could reduce borrowing costs and narrow credit-default swap spreads between countries.\n\n“This result suggests that markets may view fiscal stimulus as a way not only to accelerate the economy but also to reduce risks associated with a prolonged slump,” Auerbach and Gorodnichenko wrote. “These results suggest that effects on fiscal sustainability through the cost of government borrowing may be not particularly important.”\n\nThe authors cautioned that, independent of government action during recessions, developed countries face worrying long-term debt levels related to aging populations and accelerating health care costs. They estimated that by 2050, the U.S. will have to reduce non-interest spending by 9 percent of GDP if it hopes to maintain the current level of debt-to-GDP.","author":"Christopher Condon","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T14:00:00.000Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ig0v_7RsTstQ/v0/1200x800.jpg","digest":"97PXZHQ6/Z/5LtwiYK2CuA==\n"}

But as Dr. Evil learned after spending 30 years cryogenically preserved, it may not be enough—for many people, certainly not enough to comfortably retire on, depending on where and how long they live.\n\nA new report from GOBankingRates measures how long a million dollars would last for retirees 65 and older, state by state. It did that by multiplying the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ mean annual expenditures for that age group by a cost-of-living measure for each state, provided by the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center. The tally separated out annual spending on health care, housing, groceries, transportation, and utilities.\n\nThe upshot: If you want to stretch your dollars as far as they can go, you need to head down south.\n\nAnd here is the flip side of that picture, with more states commonly considered retirement destinations, most with the higher costs that go with that.\n\nThese are conservative figures. They don’t factor in any entertainment or travel, which would make for a pretty grim retirement. Nor do they take into account how inflation might cut into purchasing power as we age. Inflation can take a bigger bite for seniors, because medical costs, which may account for a bigger chunk of expenses, have an inflation rate significantly higher than that for the broad economy.\n\nHealth-care costs for retirees will rise at an average annual rate of 5.5 percent over the next decade, according to HealthView Services, which makes retirement health-care cost projection software. To put that in perspective, from 2012 to 2016, the average annual broad inflation rate in the U.S. was 1.9 percent.\n\nThe annual expenditure numbers also don’t factor in any return on the pot of money seniors are presumably holding while they live in retirement. Gains there could offset purchasing power lost to inflation.\n\nStill, the data are useful in starting to map the relative power of a fixed sum of savings from one state to another.\n\nFor many people, the idea of a million-dollar pot of savings for retirement is a dream. Many survive on less. For others, a million won’t be nearly enough to fund the kind of lifestyle they want when they’re older. It all boils down to your aims—and whether health issues throw you a curve.\n\nRather than be paralyzed by big numbers, retirees-to-be can focus on tracking the smaller amounts they’re spending today.

The other appeared to have blown up immediately.\n\nThe launches occurred near Kittaeryong in eastern North Korea, with the first fired at 6:49 a.m. local time. Military authorities said they didn’t pose a threat to North America or Guam.\n\nThe missile tests come shortly after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson praised North Korea for showing some restraint and suggested that dialogue could take place soon. While the launch violates United Nations resolutions, short-range rockets are generally seen as less provocative than tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles that could deliver a nuclear device to the continental U.S.\n\n“The North felt compelled to do something after Tillerson’s statement about them showing restraint,” Ralph Cossa, president of the Pacific Forum CSIS in Honolulu, said by email. “They certainly don’t want to give the impression they are backing down in the face of U.S. threats (even if they ultimately do so).”\n\nGuam Warning\n\nThe U.S. and its allies had also warned Kim against following through with a threat to launch missiles toward Guam, home to key American military bases in the Pacific. Japan earlier this month deployed four Patriot missile interceptors into the western part of the country, which would be under the flight path toward the U.S. territory.\n\nNorth Korea has conducted more than a dozen missile tests this year, including two ICBMS, leading to a war of words earlier this month between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim’s regime that rattled global markets. Tensions cooled in recent weeks, with Trump saying Tuesday that Kim was beginning to respect the U.S.\n\nTrump had been informed of the latest tests and “we are monitoring the situation,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.\n\nKorea Tensions\n\nSouth Korea planned to hold a national security council meeting on Saturday morning. South Korea’s Joint Chief of Staff said that the projectiles shot on Saturday flew in a northeasterly direction.\n\nKim’s provocations are a headache for South Korea’s new President Moon Jae-in, who won office in May pledging to engage with the regime to help bring peace to the peninsula. Moon said in a Berlin speech last month that he was willing, under the right circumstances, to meet Kim “ anytime, anywhere.”\n\nSouth Korean soldiers at an anti-terror drill on the sidelines of the joint military exercises in Seoul on Aug. 22.

It has strongly criticized military exercises led by the U.S. and South Korea that run through the end of the month.\n\nEarlier this month, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to tighten sanctions on North Korea, targeting about a third of the nation’s roughly $3 billion in exports. Kim’s regime has said it won’t give up its nuclear weapons and missile program until the U.S. drops its “hostile” policies.\n\n— With assistance by Jennifer Jacobs","author":"Kanga Kong","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-25T23:20:20.680Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i1zc2Ou7XtaM/v0/1200x796.jpg","digest":"p9GBvoWWOgjxOpewjww9Cg==\n"}

He served as chief executive officer for 25 years, transforming a regional business into the world’s largest manufacturer of generic drugs. Seeking an appropriate act of veneration for a man often described as the Steve Jobs of Israel, Teva had workers box up Hurvitz’s belongings at corporate headquarters, transport them to the Jerusalem facility, and re-create his old office on the sixth floor.\n\nOn a July afternoon, Ariel Tsiperfal, a member of the plant’s site management team, approaches with a key. “Not many people get to go in here,” he says as he unlocks the glass door of the corporate mausoleum.

He picks up the receiver and holds it to his ear and jokes, “Maybe there’s a line from above?”\n\nAfter legendary Teva CEO Hurvitz died, the company moved his belongings to Jerusalem and re-created his old office as a memorial. Source: Teva\n\nTeva could use one. The company Hurvitz built is by many measures remarkable—it had $22 billion in sales in 2016, and the 120 billion tablets and capsules it produces at 69 plants around the world fill 1 of every 6 generic prescriptions in the U.S. But since Hurvitz retired as CEO in 2002, Teva has ground through top executives and grand strategies like so many chewable pills. In that time it’s had four CEOs, the most recent of whom, Erez Vigodman, departed in February after engineering an ill-fated $40 billion deal to buy Allergan Plc’s generics division. Since that acquisition was announced, Teva’s shares have lost nearly three-quarters of their value. The latest plunge came in early August, when Teva lowered earnings forecasts, cut its dividend by 75 percent, and said it still hasn’t found a new CEO. The company is planning layoffs and assets sales to pay down its debt, which Moody’s Investors Service recently downgraded to one notch away from junk.\n\nIn Israel, where Teva has long been the most prominent symbol of the country’s entrepreneurial spirit, the turmoil is playing out as much more than a straightforward business implosion. It’s a crisis at the intersection of capitalism and nationalism. So many Israelis own Teva shares that it’s referred to as menayat ha’am—Hebrew for “the people’s stock.” In mid-August, in a dethroning that would have once been unimaginable, those shares dipped enough for Teva to lose its status as Israel’s largest company by market value. Teva directly contributed 1.3 percent of Israel’s gross domestic product in 2015, but Gilead Fortuna, a senior research fellow at the Samuel Neaman Institute for National Policy Research in Haifa, says that doesn’t include the company’s many indirect contributions to the country’s economy. On top of employing 6,800 people in Israel, Teva does business with a network of smaller Israeli companies, funds much of the nation’s academic research, and serves as a spawning place for managers who go on to run other successful businesses, he says.\n\n“You cannot force the company to be Israeli if by being Israeli it will go bankrupt”\n\nTeva’s troubles raise the possibility that it might be acquired by a foreign competitor or even forced to move its headquarters—currently in a kibbutz-like setup in the small city of Petach Tikva—to Europe or the U.S., where it could draw from deeper pools of executive talent. This is something Hurvitz worked to ensure would never happen, even after his death. To him, Teva wasn’t just a company, but a cause. He believed it drew its strength from Israel’s soil—if Teva prospered, so would its homeland. He pushed to keep as much of the company’s operations as possible in Israel, hiring local banks, accountants, and lawyers. Teva adopted bylaws stating that it must be based in Israel and that the CEO and a majority of the directors had to be residents. “For [Hurvitz], that was a sine qua non,” says Manuel Trajtenberg, a former economics professor at Tel Aviv University and Labor Party member of the Knesset. “He managed to convince everybody, from stockholders to the board, that this was the DNA of Teva, and that taking Teva away from Israel would be bad for the company.”\n\nBut it’s not so easy for Teva to uphold Hurvitz’s patriotic dream in the age of ruthless shareholder capitalism. As large as Teva looms in Israel, only about 8 percent of its shareholders are based there. The vast majority—81 percent—are in the U.S., and most rank Israeli pride a long way below their rate of return. In mid-July, Calcalist, an Israeli business news publication, reported that Teva had persuaded Pascal Soriot, the French CEO of Anglo-Swiss drug company AstraZeneca Plc, to be its next chief. Teva declined to comment; Soriot called the speculation “rumors.” It’s unclear whether even a highly regarded executive such as Soriot could please shareholders while maintaining Teva’s Israeli-ness. That was a trick that only Hurvitz, who was known as Mr. Teva, seemed to be able to pull off.\n\n“You cannot force the company to be Israeli if by being Israeli it will go bankrupt,” says Benny Landa, a prominent Israeli technology entrepreneur who owns Teva shares. “You can’t.”\n\nIn 1953, Hurvitz, a 21-year-old economics major at Tel Aviv University with thick brown hair and elfin good looks, reported to Assia Chemical Labs in Petach Tikva for work as a part-time test-tube washer. He’d recently married Dalia Salomon: They met while Hurvitz was working on a kibbutz; he traveled to their dates on a tractor, according to his biographer, Yossi Goldstein. Dalia also happened to be the daughter of the CEO of Assia, and once Hurvitz graduated, he ascended into the executive ranks. He expanded Assia’s business into Africa, leading a fleet of the company’s vans into the Nigerian bush, where they supplied missionary hospitals. In 1968 he orchestrated the hostile takeover of Israel’s largest drugmaker—Teva, which means “nature” in Hebrew.\n\nBy then, Israel was in the throes of the Arab boycott. American drug companies supported the ban for fear of angering the majority of their customers in the Middle East, but they allowed Israeli companies to manufacture local versions of U.S. drugs. Teva had already been making some generics, but now it was able to expand and refine its copycat business. “We used to get up every morning and thank God for the Arab boycott,” Hurvitz said in 2004. By the early 1980s, Teva was making almost 100 different generic products.\n\nThat meant Hurvitz was ready when the U.S. passed the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, which loosened restrictions on generics and gave Teva the chance to enter the unbranded-drug market in America. Once the patent expired on a branded drug, the law allowed the first company to win Food and Drug Administration approval for a generic to sell the knockoff version exclusively for six months. That created the opportunity for tremendous profits for copycat medication makers, who after all hadn’t spent fortunes on research, development, and marketing. Teva’s scientists found ways to replicate the effects of branded drugs using different ingredients. And while other generic manufacturers simply waited for patents to expire, Teva had its lawyers hasten the process by persuading judges to invalidate them ahead of schedule.\n\nTeva lacked the funding and expertise to create its own drugs. But in 1987, Michael Sela and Ruth Arnon, researchers at Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science, approached Hurvitz about a promising multiple sclerosis treatment they’d developed. Hurvitz saw a chance to demonstrate to the world that Israelis could do more than just copy drugs; they could create their own. “He said, ‘This is an opportunity. It will be a blue-and-white Israeli development, and we’re going for it,’ ” Arnon recalls.\n\nThe medication became known as Copaxone. In 1996 it became the first Israeli drug to be approved by the FDA, and it was a hit. Over the years, it has generated as much as 20 percent of Teva’s annual sales. Hurvitz became a national hero. Friends tried to get him to run for mayor of Jerusalem. Candidates for prime minister tried to enlist him as finance minster. Hurvitz demurred; he didn’t want to get involved in politics when there was so much for him to do at Teva. The roof of the headquarters sometimes leaked, and cooking odors wafted up from the cafeteria below. But Hurvitz took pride in his scrappy operation. His employees dressed casually, dined on simple food, and enjoyed challenging the conventional wisdom of their spendy European and American rivals.\n\nIn 2002, Mr. Teva retired as CEO, but he retained his control of the company as chairman. He showed up for work every day, down the hall from his chosen replacement, Israel Makov, the former chief operating officer. But Hurvitz turned out to be much less brilliant at succession planning than generics strategy. He later told his biographer Goldstein that Makov committed the ultimate treason: He tried to sell Teva to a group of investors including wealthy Americans allied with Teva’s competitors. According to Goldstein, Hurvitz short-circuited the deal and arranged for Makov’s toppling in 2007.\n\nFinding a new CEO was harder this time. The natural candidate—George Barrett, president of Teva’s North American divisions—was an American and wouldn’t relocate. So Hurvitz recruited Shlomo Yanai, a square-jawed former major general in the Israeli Defense Forces. Yanai didn’t know the first thing about pharmaceuticals, but Hurvitz was certain he could teach the newcomer anything he needed to know. That was true enough until Hurvitz, who’d been diagnosed with cancer, relinquished his position as chairman in 2010. Without Mr. Teva to guide him, Yanai engineered the $6.8 billion acquisition of Cephalon Inc., a U.S. drugmaker. The deal was rushed—Teva spent only a month on due diligence—and the consensus on Wall Street was that it had exorbitantly overpaid. Three months after the deal closed, the company said Yanai was leaving.\n\nThe next CEO was Jeremy Levin, former director of strategy at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. in the U.S. Born in South Africa and educated at Oxford and Cambridge, Levin had spent his summers working on a kibbutz in Israel and was a Zionist. He was more than happy to move to Tel Aviv. But almost immediately he found himself at odds with Teva’s Israeli-dominated board, which included Hurvitz’s son, Chaim. The directors found Levin’s suits and ties too formal, his accent too British, and his $4.5 million renovation of the Petach Tikva headquarters far too extravagant.\n\n“We used to get up every morning and thank God for the Arab boycott”\n\nIt didn’t seem to matter that some investors believed Levin had the right strategy. Back in 1984, when the Hatch-Waxman law passed, generics accounted for 19 percent of U.S. drug sales. Their share had since passed 70 percent, and the space was more competitive and less lucrative. Levin wanted Teva to focus more on developing its own specialty drugs such as Copaxone. That impressed tech investor Landa, who bought a stake in Teva—only to watch as Levin was forced out by the board after just 18 months on the job. “He wasn’t Israeli,” Ruth Cheshin, a former Teva director, said at the time.\n\nLanda contacted other investors and started agitating for corporate governance reform. “It’s like a banana republic,” Landa says in an interview at his office on the outskirts of Rehovot, a town near Tel Aviv. “It’s so demeaning to have the board of Israel’s only global company behave in such an unprofessional matter.”\n\nIn January 2014 the board selected yet another CEO: Erez Vigodman, who’d been a Teva director since 2009. He’d run a company that exported hummus and another that dealt in generic agricultural products but had never managed a drugmaker. Landa was again infuriated. “The board announces, ‘We’re doing a global search, and we’re going to find the best possible candidate to run the company,’ ” he says. “And then they come out and they say: ‘You know what? You won’t believe it. He’s been right under our very noses all the time. He knows nothing about pharma, but, hey, he’s one of us.’ ”\n\nA broad-shouldered technocrat with a centurion’s helmet of gray hair, Vigodman lacked Hurvitz’s charm. He tended to speak in jargon, even in private, and when he gave speeches, he sounded like a drill sergeant. But Vigodman emulated Mr. Teva as best he could. He hired Hurvitz’s former chauffeur and secretary. “He started off on the right foot,” says Peter Langerman, CEO of Franklin Mutual Series, one of Teva’s largest shareholders. It helped that Teva introduced a popular version of Copaxone in 2014 with a patent that extended to 2030.\n\nDuring the Levin era, Teva had forsworn large acquisitions, but that changed under Vigodman. Pfizer Inc. expressed interest in buying the company in 2014, and according to someone who spoke frequently with him, Vigodman became obsessed with doing a big deal to keep Teva out of the hands of a foreign company—in effect, by making itself too big to swallow. Vigodman approached Brent Saunders, then CEO of Actavis Plc, a drug company headquartered in Ireland, about acquiring his company, which focused heavily on generics. But Saunders was in the midst of merging Actavis with Allergan, the maker of Botox, and politely declined the overture. Vigodman ended up making a $40 billion hostile bid for Mylan NV, another drug company specializing in generics that’s based in the Netherlands.\n\n“Every morning I wake up, and I have to resist the forces trying to move Teva out of Israel ”\n\nMylan’s brash chairman, Robert Coury, was pursuing a hostile bid of his own for Perrigo Co., an Irish company. He sent Vigodman a scalding letter that referred to Teva as “dysfunctional” and noted its CEO churn. “We believe that these rapid changes in a short period of time have left the company with a complete lack of long-term strategic focus,” Coury wrote.\n\nVigodman responded with his own letter. “We, like every company—including yours—have had issues and front-page ‘black eyes’ in the past,” he wrote.\n\nAs Teva’s pursuit of Mylan devolved into volleys of insults, Saunders came to Vigodman’s apparent rescue. He’d completed the merger of Actavis and Allergan. At a conference in New York hosted by David Maris, then a drug industry analyst at BMO Capital Markets, Saunders coyly let it be known that he was open to shedding his generics business. According to Maris, Michael Hayden, Teva’s head of R\u0026D, happened to be in the audience. Maris says Hayden got up, walked out of the auditorium, and called Vigodman, urging him to go back to Saunders. As Maris recounts it: “Erez says, ‘Look, I’m not going to do it again. I’ve already asked him two or three times, and he’s already said no. I’m making Teva look stupid now.’ Michael said, ‘You know what? The way he said it today, I think there’s an opening.’ ”\n\nVigodman met Saunders for lunch at a location where no reporters or investors were likely to spot them: a restaurant along Interstate 78 in New Jersey. Within two weeks they’d thrashed out a deal, which they announced on July 27, 2015: Teva would acquire Allergan’s Actavis division for $40 billion.\n\nThat month, Teva’s shares peaked—and then began a slide that continues today. Scandals erupted around drug pricing, and U.S. presidential candidates from both parties threatened to regulate the industry more aggressively. Separately, Teva was subpoenaed by the U.S. Department of Justice as part of an investigation of alleged price-fixing in the generics sector. (Teva says it has done nothing wrong.) The company had to lower its revenue and profit forecasts for 2016 because of product launch delays and other problems. And in September, in a cosmic twist, Teva lost a U.S. federal court case challenging its patents on its newer version of Copaxone, opening the door for competitors to do what Teva itself had enjoyed doing for so many years: rush generic versions to market.\n\nAs the company’s stock sank in late 2016, Allergan’s began to recover. “Brent Saunders did one of the best deals of the last few years in health care,” says Maris, now an analyst for Wells Fargo \u0026 Co. “He sold something at a great price right when the sector was turning out to be a lot less profitable.”\n\n“We will get a high-quality CEO. We will find one, and we will bring that person to Israel”\n\nBy last winter, Vigodman was spending much of his time in the U.S., trying to mollify shareholders increasingly inclined to see the company’s presence in Israel and insistence on Israeli-minded executives as a liability. Back in Tel Aviv, in a meeting with journalists at the stock exchange, Vigodman said, “Every morning I wake up, and I have to resist the forces trying to move Teva out of Israel.” In early January he appeared at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. “He looked terrible, exhausted, worn out, tired,” says Andy Summers, a money manager at Janus Capital Management. He says investors told Teva directors who’d come along with Vigodman that he had to go. The following month, Teva announced that he’d resigned. But investors knew the score. “He got pushed out,” says Tim Call, chief investment officer at Capital Management Corp. (Vigodman declined to comment.)\n\nOnce again, Teva embarked on a global search for a new CEO. In March, Sol Barer, the company’s chairman, acknowledged that Teva would look outside Israel. “We have strong Israeli roots,” he said in an interview at the time. “It’s actually a competitive edge. But at the end of the day, we’re going to bring in somebody from around the world. The choices will be from around the world. That’s the first priority.” On Aug. 16, Barer gives an update by phone. “We will get a high-quality CEO,” he says. “We will find one, and we will bring that person to Israel.”\n\n“Sol, Sol,” interjects a public-relations liaison. “The last thing you said was, ‘And we will bring that person to Israel.’ I think what you meant to say was, ‘We will bring that person to Teva.’ ”\n\n“I’m sorry,” Barer says. “Yes, to Teva. Ha, ha, thank you. I’ve had a long day.”\n\nSome Teva employees may not be around to see another CEO. The company plans to lay off 7,000 worldwide before the end of the year. At Teva’s Kfar Saba plant north of Tel Aviv, the workers have hung banners in the hallways reading “We won’t be the victims.”\n\n“My heart hurts with what’s happening to Teva,” says Eliran Kozlik, chairman of the factory’s labor union. “Every day, I’m following the stock.” In the lobby a little later, he checks Teva’s share price on his phone and groans. It’s down an additional 4 percent so far that day. Behind Kozlik, there’s a portrait on the wall of Hurvitz looking skyward, as if for deliverance.","author":"Devin Leonard, Yaacov Benmeleh","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-23T04:01:06.779Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKkevDw2GTZs/v0/-1x-1.jpg","digest":"zmLtJVVN+IOAyvprONvZmQ==\n"}

Swipe right!\n\nIt turns out credit scores are statistical shorthand for a whole lot more than the likelihood you'll repay a loan, according to a number of consumer surveys and academic studies. One study, released two years ago, looked at consumer credit data over 15 years and found that the higher the year-end credit score, the likelier the person was to form a romantic relationship over the next year.\n\nNow comes a survey from Discover Financial Services and Match Media Group, parent of Tinder and other dating sites, that shows just how appealing a good credit score can be. Financial responsibility was ranked as a very or extremely important quality in a potential mate by 69 percent of the 2,000 online daters surveyed. That placed it ahead of sense of humor (67 percent), attractiveness (51 percent), ambition (50 percent), courage (42 percent), and modesty (39 percent). A good credit score was associated with being responsible, trustworthy, and smart.\n\nThat’s right. These amorous respondents effectively put credit score 18 points ahead of cute.\n\nOther salacious details:\n\nThose dating-app pictures of people in cool cars or cute gym outfits? Nah, gimme a scorching 810. A good credit score is more appealing than a nice car, said 58 percent of those surveyed. More people might swipe right if daters put up a screenshot of that\n\nred-hot percentage.\n\n“If you’ve got a pretty good credit score, you probably have other good personality traits,” said biological anthropologist Helen Fisher, Match.com’s chief scientific adviser and a senior research fellow at the Kinsey Institute. “You’re not only managing your money, you’re managing your family, your friends. You’re kind of a managing person. It says a lot more about you than a fancy car.” She even called it “an honest indicator of who you really are.”\n\nShe even called it a “Darwinian mechanism for measuring your reproductive ability.” (!)\n\nThere is something to this. What do people want in a mate? Many want someone who is responsible, dependable, willing to commit, and able to maintain a relationship. What does it take to get a good credit score? Mostly a long history of responsibility, dependability, and careful maintenance of accounts. Both sexes in the survey valued financial responsibility highly—77 percent of females and 61 percent of men.\n\nBeth Rahn, a vice president for a private equity firm in Chicago and a user of online dating sites, is one of the 77 percent. Rahn, 30, thinks asking directly about the credit score on a first date would be a “quick way to scare someone off.” And if a date bragged about an 810 out of the blue, it would be a turnoff. But if the two of them were commiserating about loans or rates, say, and the 810 came up that way, she said, “my immediate reaction would be that they are responsible, on top of their expenses, they’ve been able to effectively manage debt in the past, whether it’s student loan debt, credit card debt or a mortgage.”\n\nDating someone whose score is similar to yours when you meet increases the odds the relationship will succeed, a 2015 paper, Credit Scores and Committed Relationships (PDF), found. When you meet, because married couples’ credit scores tend to converge over time.\n\nThe authors analyzed 15 years of data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax, which covers millions of consumers and provided detailed credit record information. People “with higher credit scores are more likely to form committed relationships relative to other observably similar individuals” and more likely to maintain relationships, the authors found. They identified committed relationships by creating an algorithm to spot the formation and dissolution of marriages and long-term cohabitation.\n\nSource: “Credit Scores and Committed Relationships”\n\nThe bigger the mismatch in scores when daters meet, the higher the likelihood the relationship won’t work out in the long run, the data showed. For example, between two couples, one with scores of 700 each and another with scores of 660 and 730, the second couple would have greater odds of separating.\n\nBut this is no statistics lesson. This is lo-o-o-ove. Just look:\n\nSource: “Credit Scores and Committed Relationships”\n\nMind you, it’s also true that people with excellent credit scores are likelier than those with bad scores to be frequent exercisers and bigger fans of Charlie Rose than of Jimmy Kimmel, and to prefer hockey to soccer and dogs to cats. And Taylor Swift to Kanye West. That’s according to a 2016 WalletHub survey of 1,000 consumers.\n\nEven if we accept that the score is a proxy for inclinations and tastes, guiding us toward people in the same socioeconomic circles with similar financial behaviors, can that 810 really release a rush of dopamine?\n\nPerhaps not, Fisher allowed, noting that dopamine is the brain chemical associated with feelings of intense romantic love. But there is a different brain system in which “it could really stimulate some of the molecular structure for attachment,” she said. That system is tied to mating and reproduction and involves feelings of deep attachment. A credit score could trigger feelings about reliability and responsibility and trustworthiness, which could trigger that attachment system, she said.\n\nAt any rate (and that rate will depend on your credit score), daters may want to trust but verify. A survey done earlier this year for student loan company SoFi found that nearly 24 percent of respondents said a date or partner had lied to them about how much debt they carried. The 2,000 millennial daters surveyed said debt was the second-biggest potential deal-breaker, behind workaholism. That may explain why 40 percent said they’d rather talk about their socially transmitted diseases than their debt.\n\nIn the Discover/Match survey, only 7 percent of online daters said they would provide information on their credit score, debt level, income, and spending habits before meeting a date IRL. For most people, the soonest they’d feel comfortable sharing financial details is sometime in the first six months of a relationship.\n\n“It can be difficult enough to find someone you’re compatible with, so to suddenly go from this emotional connection to this practical part of your brain, it can seem incredibly clinical, and you don’t want that,” said Adam Scott, a financial planner at Westside Investment Management in Santa Monica, California. “But if you don’t pay attention in the beginning, you aren’t building your relationship on a sound footing, and it will come back to haunt you.” Being on the same basic page financially will “ultimately be one of the predictors of the success of the relationship,” he said. “It will be one of the defining things, maybe even more than sex.”\n\nPeople may be hesitant to reveal their credit scores now, but “the data suggest that it might become the norm over time,” said Kate Manfred, vice president of brand communications and consumer insights for Discover. She envisions a day when people “do dueling phones and you pull up your scores right there, in under 60 seconds. You pull out your phone and say, ‘Look, here’s my credit score, what’s yours? Let’s swap.’ ”\n\n\n\nOr, as Shakespeare wrote:\n\nMy mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun\n\nHer sweetest gift, a lambent 801.\n\nHave personal finance questions or lessons to share?

Musk said via Twitter on Friday that Neuralink isn’t seeking outside investors.

The company’s sparse website says it’s “developing ultra-high bandwith brain-machine interfaces to connect humans and computers.” It’s also recruiting engineers and scientists to join the effort.\n\n“No neuroscience experience is required: talent and drive matter far more,” the company says on the site. “We expect most of our team to come from other areas and industries.”","author":"Dana Hull","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-25T19:47:49.315Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i7cATmJS3aH4/v0/1200x825.jpg","digest":"Jlz6gRDbtBpAY6W2Z3oeZw==\n"}

Some places even far inland were predicted to get as much as 40 inches of rain through Wednesday.\n\nWhile the worst of the storm surge had ended by midday Saturday, the coastal flooding threat was due to increase as already-swollen rivers and bayous get pounded with heavy rain, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said. Sea water pushed onto the shore also won't recede quickly, he said, meaning \"this is going to be a long, ongoing flood event.\"\n\nAbbott said the 210-mile-long corridor between Corpus Christi and Houston was expected to receive as much as 30 more inches of rain on top of the double-digit rainfall figures that had already fallen.\n\n#Harvey made landfall at 10 PM CDT as a category 4 hurricane near Rockport, Texas, with max winds of 130 mph and min pressure of 938 mb. pic.twitter.com/98y5wpKmBw — NHC Atlantic Ops (@NHC_Atlantic) August 26, 2017\n\nHarvey wielded the \"highest potential to kill the most amount of people and cause the most amount of damage,\" Brock Long, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, had warned.

They’ve all dreamt up epic star-studded music videos we’re still very much obsessed with.\n\nThese performers aren’t the only ones showing off their famous friends, however. Keep scrolling to see more memorable music video squads, courtesy of Fergie, Beyoncé and more.\n\n“Swish Swish” — Katy Perry ft. Nicki Minaj\n\nThe high-profile celebrities featured on the “Swish Swish” basketball court? Nicki Minaj, Terry Crews, Molly Shannon, Strangers Things‘ Gaten Matarazzo, and Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson a.k.a. The Mountain from Game of Thrones.\n\n“Bad Blood” — Taylor Swift ft. Kendrick Lamar\n\nAlso known as the moment we were formally introduced to the majority of Swift’s squad — which includes Lena Dunham, Cara Delevingne, Karlie Kloss and Selena Gomez — “Bad Blood” also featured Jessica Alba and Cindy Crawford … because why not?\n\n“On the Run (Part II)” — Beyoncé \u0026 JAY-Z\n\nOne issue we have with this faux movie trailer — starring Sean Penn, Blake Lively, Emmy Rossum and Jake Gyllenhaal, among others — is that it pumped us up for a faux epic action film that never came to be. (Insert all the sad face emojis here.) (NSFW language in the video above.)\n\n“M.I.L.F. $” — Fergie\n\nBecause dreaming up a music video of Hollywood’s hottest celeb moms without having Ciara, Kim Kardashian West, Chrissy Teigen and Alessandra Ambrosio starring in it would be a downright travesty.\n\n“Happy” — Pharrell Williams\n\nBecause we’re “Happy” to live in a time where we can see Steve Carell, Jamie Foxx, Kelly Osbourne, Jimmy Kimmel and more celebs dance like no one’s watching.\n\n“Bitch I’m Madonna” — Madonna ft. Nicki Minaj\n\nLeave it to Madge to show off her famous friends — Beyoncé, Kanye West, Nicki Minaj, Katy Perry, Chris Rock, Rita Ora, Miley Cyrus and more — in the video for her super-catchy single.\n\n“Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)” — Katy Perry\n\nThe singer took us back to the 1980s with this house party-set video that not only features unofficial Friday ambassador Rebecca Black and Darren Criss but also Hanson, Corey Feldman and Debbie Gibson.\n\n“My Song 5” — Haim ft. A$AP Ferg\n\nKesha, Vanessa Bayer, Big Sean, Grimes and more famous folks make their Haim music video debut for the band’s “My Song 5” single.\n\n“A Public Affair” — Jessica Simpson\n\nBecause when you’re as famous as Jessica Simpson, Eva Longoria, Christina Milian and Christina Applegate, heading to a rollerskating rink can cause quite the commotion.\n\n“Giving Up the Gun” — Vampire Weekend\n\nThe Vampire Weekend music video sees Joe Jonas, Daft Punk and Jake Gyllenhaal go head-to-head with a tennis champ — while Lil Jon serves as the girl’s coach and RZA takes on the role of referee.\n\nThis article originally appeared on People.com.","author":"Grace Gavilanes ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T21:27:27.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/katy-perry-taylor-swift-pharrell.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C2700px%2C1419px\u0026resize=1200%2C630","digest":"TKCSj9T0dSclJ68R/icPGg==\n"}

She was first diagnosed breast cancer in 1992 and underwent a partial mastectomy, nine months of chemotherapy and a breast reconstruction. After beating the disease, she became an impassioned advocate for breast cancer research and early detection.\n\nEarlier this month, Newton-John told fans she was “feeling great” and would be returning to the road. Thursday’s show at the Victory Theatre was the first in a series of concert dates that will keep her on the road until December.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Olivia Newton-John Reveals Cancer Diagnosis After Postponing Tour\n\nWhile no meet and greets are being offered so Newton-John can “focus on performing the best show for everyone,” her site explained, the Grease star did receive one special message from a fan before Thursday’s show — and gave him the surprise of his life in return.\n\nBefore singing her 2006 song “Grace and Gratitude,” the star thanked guitarist Andy Timmons for surprising her at the show, her husband John Easterling, and Kentucky resident Byron Witham — a fan who was in the audience.\n\nTurns out, Witham had shown up to the show with a bouquet of flowers for the star that he hoped to present her with on stage after she finished her first song. The arrangement came with a card that read “Dear Olivia, Welcome Back! Love, Byron Witham.”\n\nUnfortunately, attendants at the Victory Theatre told him upon entering that he wouldn’t be able to do that. But an employee told him she would take the flowers to Newton-John instead. She even followed up with the Witham later on to tell them she had passed the bouquet on to the singer’s assistant.\n\nWitham was “extremely happy” to know Newton-John was getting them, as he wrote on a Facebook post explaining what happened. Still, he was “a little miffed” he didn’t get to give them to her himself.\n\nAll that went flying out the window when Newton-John mentioned his name. “And I’d like to thank a very kind gentleman in the audience, Byron Witham, for his beautiful flowers — they’re so lovely,” she said, in video Witham added to his post.\n\nIt’s unclear what happened after that. The video cuts off — right as Witham drops his phone.\n\n“I nearly died!” he said. “I was filming this without knowing I would even be mentioned. It happens at the end of this video, and you hear me begin to say, ‘Oh My God’….but I dropped my phone! LOL! I cried for the rest of the concert.”","author":"Dave Quinn ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T20:15:39.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-620646132.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px\u0026resize=1200%2C630","digest":"GGQGAHp2+sJZHEXPJA9AKQ==\n"}

The teleporting dog of the Inhuman royal family popped in for a new character poster on Saturday, a.k.a. National Dog Day.\n\nWith the ability to transport himself and others across dimensions, Lockjaw serves as protector and escort to his family. In the footage from Inhumans, we see him whisking Blackbolt (Anson Mount) away from his usurper, brother Maximus (Iwan Rheon).\n\n“Lockjaw is probably going to end up being the audience’s favorite character,” showrunner Scott Buck told EW. “We certainly enjoy working with him. He’s fun to write, he’s fun to shoot. There’s not too much more detail than that that I can give, but he is going to be a standout on the show.”\n\nBehold the Royal Protector of \"Marvel's #Inhumans.\" Lockjaw has arrived to kick off #NationalDogDay! 🐶 pic.twitter.com/huibBfVHeN — Marvel Entertainment (@Marvel) August 26, 2017\n\nThe one-sheet comes after ABC and Marvel released a series of posters for other characters, including Serinda Swan’s Queen Medusa, Isabelle Cornish’s Crystal, Eme Ikwuakor’s Gorgon, Mike Moh’s Triton, and Ken Leung’s Karnak.\n\nSee them below.\n\nBehold The Royal Family!

The theater’s board deemed the 1939 film “insensitive” to their larger audience after receiving “numerous comments” that stemmed from a screening on Aug. 11. As such, the title has been dropped from next year’s planned summer movie series.\n\n“While title selections for the series are typically made in the spring of each year, the Orpheum has made this determination early in response to specific inquiries from patrons,” read a statement from The Orpheum Theatre Group. “The Orpheum appreciates feedback on its programming from all members of the mid-south community. The recent screening of Gone With the Wind at the Orpheum on Friday, August 11, 2017, generated numerous comments. The Orpheum carefully reviewed all of them.”\n\nThe statement continued, “As an organization whose stated mission is to ‘entertain, educate and enlighten the communities it serves,’ the Orpheum cannot show a film that is insensitive to a large segment of its local population.”\n\nGone With the Wind, which won eight Academy Awards, features life on a Southern plantation during the Civil War and Reconstruction periods. Over the years, the subject matter has proven to be quite divisive for perpetuating a sympathetic view of the South during this time.\n\nAs posted on the Orpheum’s Facebook page event for the August screening, one user called the film “racist.” Another remarked over news of the canceled screening, “slowly but surely, we will rid this community of all tributes to white supremacy.”\n\nThe Orpheum will be “announcing an exciting movie series in the spring of 2018 that will, as always, contain both classic films and more recent blockbusters.”","author":"Nick Romano","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T17:53:48.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/mcdgowi_ec087_h.jpg?crop=0px%2C24px%2C2700px%2C1418px\u0026resize=1200%2C630","digest":"pzi/1n+B+SFCyBZ39Uc3EA==\n"}

That's what we're here to turn into reality.\"\n\nBut be honest, the fight makes no logical sense. Mayweather is a legendary boxer and supreme defender who will be facing an opponent who is outstanding in the Octagon but a novice in the ring and making his pro boxing debut.\n\nMost experts view it as an abject mismatch, so that it was sanctioned by the Nevada State Athletic Commission was something of an upset. But it was, and now they'll engage in a 12-round junior middleweight spectacle that has the world's attention on Saturday night.\n\n\"Mayweather versus McGregor has captured the imagination of sports fans across the world. It's a historic event demanded by the fans and put on for the fans,\" Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe said. \"The fighters will put their talents on display in a fight that people did not think was possible.

Our panel of MMA and boxing handicappers is here to help.\n\nHow the WWE would script Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor The circus surrounding the Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor fight has some pure fight fans shaking their heads at the spectacle, but what if they turned up the melodrama to 11 by crossing over into the WWE Universe? We imagine how it would all play out. 2 Related\n\nNo matter how small the risk is for Mayweather -- many believe it will be one of his easiest fights -- there is still some element of risk when another man is throwing punches at your head.\n\nMayweather is 40. Mayweather hasn't fought in two years. And Mayweather, of Las Vegas, is gambling his perfect record and a brilliant Hall of Fame legacy that could be ruined with one punch from a guy who looks like he barely knows how to throw a proper boxing punch.\n\nIf McGregor, 29, of Ireland, wins, many will consider it the biggest upset in sports history. At least when Buster Douglas knocked out Mike Tyson it was a boxer knocking out a boxer. When the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team upset the Russians they were still hockey players facing other hockey players. When the Jets beat the Colts in Super Bowl III, the Jets were football players beating other football players.\n\nMcGregor is not a boxer, and there is no way he could make himself into an elite one in a matter of months. Mayweather, who comes from a boxing family, has boxed for virtually his entire life.\n\nThat experts give McGregor almost no chance to win, or to even compete, has merely motivated the \"Notorious\" one.\n\n\"It's certainly motivating,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"The disrespect and the disregard to my skill set is disappointing. I look at people so many times and their mind is closed. They've got a closed mind to how things can be done. It's a set way and there's no other way. Where if that was the case we'd never have reached across the waters and searched for other lands and we'd never have went into space.\" Conor McGregor\n\nUFC president Dana White, McGregor's promoter, has been emphatic that his star has what it takes to get the job done.\n\n\"Don't judge a fight until the fight is over,\" White said. \"You never know what's going to happen, especially with a guy like Conor who hits like a truck. When he hurts someone, he puts them away. Floyd is almost 41 years old. Conor is a young southpaw who hits hard. We'll see how it plays out. It's crazy to think that Conor won't connect with him.\"\n\nMayweather has played up McGregor's chances by pounding home the fact that even though McGregor is 21-3 with 18 knockouts in MMA, he has never lost standing up, only by submission.\n\n\"McGregor is a tough competitor. He's undefeated standing up. He's never lost when striking. I know that I'm in for a tough fight,\" Mayweather said. \"But there is one thing I do know, this fight is not going the distance. No matter what anyone says, it's not going the distance.\"\n\nFor his part, McGregor is undaunted by his lack of boxing experience. He says his southpaw stance, which occasionally has given Mayweather minor problems, and his determination, aggression and punching power, especially in his left hand, will result in an early knockout.\n\n\"If people are overlooking my size, power and youth, they shouldn't be. I'm very confident in those attributes. I believe I'll knock him out early,\" McGregor said. \"If you look at the way I fight, I am a fast starter. I come out and bang people right away. With eight-ounce gloves, I don't see him lasting more than one or two rounds. I am my own man and I feel I am superior to Floyd. When it comes to Saturday night, he will not be prepared for me.\n\n\"He's a beaten man. He will not be able to take the ferociousness that I come with. I'm very confident. I have more skills in many areas, and as a true martial artist, I can adapt to any situation.\"\n\nThe World Boxing Council will award the \"Money Belt\" to the winner of Saturday's fight between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor. World Boxing Council\n\nCha-ching!\n\nMany expect the fight to break all of the revenue records set by the 2015 megafight between Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, including total revenue (about $600 million), most pay-per-view sales (4.6 million) and all-time gate ($72.2 million). The fight is also expected to set the Las Vegas fight wager record. Bookmakers handled about $50 million in action on Mayweather-Pacquiao and expect Saturday's fight to exceed $60 million.\n\n\"The numbers are tracking huge,\" White said. \"We are going to do the numbers that everybody has been talking we are going to do. The over/under line in Vegas is 4.9 million (pay-per-view buys). Everything is tracking right now to say that we are going to kill this thing. So it is looking really good.\"\n\nThe fight will be available in more than 200 countries and territories, and because of the massive amount of revenue that will roll in, the fighters will each make nine-figure paydays. Mayweather, who has made more money than any other fighter in history, will add substantially to his earnings and is likely to surpass the roughly $250 million he earned against Pacquiao. McGregor's likely haul of more than $100 million will dwarf anything he has made for a fight in the Octagon.\n\n\"This is huge, the numbers that we've been hearing about, they've been crazy,\" Mayweather said.\n\nSaid Showtime Sports boss Stephen Espinoza: \"This will be the most widely distributed event in pay-per-view history. This event will be distributed in over 200 countries [and territories] and might grow to 225 by the time we're done. We are well on our way to being a record-setting event in many categories.\"\n\nMcGregor is also thrilled with the business of the fight.\n\n\"I saw it pointing to record-breaking numbers all across the board, from the gate to the sponsorships to the pay-per-view. Absolutely every angle,\" McGregor said. \"So I am very, very happy with how it has gone.\"\n\nUFC star Conor McGregor will step into the boxing ring for his first professional bout and face Floyd Mayweather on Saturday in Las Vegas. Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n\nBoxing vs. MMA\n\nOf course, the fight is a boxing match not an MMA bout. But that hasn't stopped legions from looking at it as one sport against the other. It's silly, because they are different sports, but that's just the way it is.\n\nMcGregor really has nothing lose in that respect. If he loses, he was supposed to. Remember, he's not a boxer. A Mayweather loss is on him, but it would probably reflect badly on boxing because of Mayweather's stature.\n\n\"I truly believe I'm taking the bigger risk. But it's a big reward for both. I have the 49-0 record. When a fighter has lost before, if he loses again, they say, 'Oh, it's nothing. He's lost before.' But when a fighter has been dominating for 20-some years -- never lost -- everything is on the line; my legacy, my boxing record, everything is on the line.\" Floyd Mayweather\n\nAs long as it's a decent fight, White said, the outcome won't reflect badly on either sport.\n\n\"I don't think it hurts either sport,\" he said. \"I think this is one of those cool situations where two guys are willing to take the risk to fight each other, and I think that this thing has captured the imagination of people. That is how this fight was built. This fight was really built through the fans and the media.\"\n\nMayweather, who has said he would consider himself a failure in the fight if he didn't score a knockout, guaranteed he will get it and that boxing has nothing to worry about.\n\n\"Nothing is a threat,\" he said. \"Boxing is legendary, and boxing is here to stay.\"\n\nHe added, \"When he gets hit, he's going to find out that this is totally different [than MMA]. The brittle hands? Let him keep saying all that. When I come across his head, he's going to find out what it really is. Believe me. This fight is not going the distance, I'm telling you.\"\n\nMcGregor is the outsider but hopes to prove his worth as a boxer.\n\n\"I get it. I'm coming in; I'm supposed to be from another sport and so again, I understand where it's at,\" he said. \"But I'm just looking forward to [Saturday], going in and proving what I'm saying and then educating the world on what martial arts are and giving the fans and everybody a good solid fight and earning my respect in this game also.\"\n\nESPN Stats and Information\n\n50-0?\n\nWhen Mayweather retired in 2015 after waltzing past Andre Berto, he reached 49-0, the hallowed mark of the great heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano. Although it's not an actual record in boxing -- several fighters have begun their careers with more consecutive victories -- it is a revered accomplishment.\n\nIt seemed inevitable that Mayweather would return for a crack at 50-0, and here it is.\n\nMayweather, however, said that sweet round number is not a big part of his motivation for returning and he does not burn to surpass Marciano.\n\n\"I don't focus on other fighters, but I'm appreciative for every fighter that paved the way for me to be where I'm at,\" he said. \"I always talk about how I appreciate the legendary fighters. My focus is to go out there and give the fans an exciting fight even though I know this is No. 50 and we're constantly talking about Rocky Marciano.\n\n\"I just always like to let the fans and the people know Rocky Marciano is a legend. Rocky Marciano did it his way, and I would just like to try to do it the Mayweather way. It wouldn't matter if I was 46-0, it didn't matter if I was 10-0 or 1-0. I just feel like I am blessed to be where I am at and I am appreciative.\"\n\nKeep it clean\n\nOne question asked often during the lead-up to the fight is what would happen if McGregor decided to use his MMA repertoire on Mayweather -- maybe throw an elbow or kick or slam him to the mat.\n\nAnything, of course, can happen, and that is probably one of the allures of the match for some. However, McGregor is not known as a dirty MMA fighter and everyone involved expects him to act professionally in the ring. Besides, if he doesn't, there will be big problems.\n\n\"There is a significant penalty. The details will remain confidential, but there is a significant penalty in the event of what could be described as an extreme foul, an out of the ordinary foul of what your normal boxing foul would be,\" Espinoza said.\n\nWhite was adamant that it would not happen, saying not only would McGregor face heavy contractual penalties but also a lawsuit.\n\n\"That will not happen. First of all, obviously, that is absolutely in the contract, No. 1. And, No. 2, this is a boxing match under the Nevada State Athletic Commission under the rules of boxing,\" White said. \"When you go to court it's always about damages, and the damages on Mayweather if something like that happened would be massive. That can't happen. ... Forget about the contract. [Mayweather] would just sue him and he would have a lawsuit against him that would destroy Conor and Mayweather would win.\"\n\nRafael's prediction: Mayweather by seventh-round knockout.","author":"Dan RafaelESPN Senior Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-25T14:07:40.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0823%2Fr248082_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"VXt5ntBy5mBD+xcu8lpJ+Q==\n"}

Rarely does the public wager much on anything that is not officially announced,\" Sherman told ESPN.\n\nWhen the fight was officially announced on June 14, the price \"opened\" with Mayweather -1100/McGregor +700.

(0:45)\n\nBrady is 'hoping for the best' with Edelman (0:45)\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- With the New England Patriots suspecting that wide receiver Julian Edelman tore his ACL, which would end his season, the obvious follow-up is where the team goes from here.\n\nThe bottom line: While not downplaying how valuable Edelman is to the offense, the Patriots still have a plethora of weapons to help them in their efforts to fill the void.\n\nIt will have to be similar to how the Patriots have adjusted without tight end Rob Gronkowski in recent years, because there isn't a one-for-one replacement for Edelman and the rapport he's built with quarterback Tom Brady over the past eight years.\n\nJulian Edelman has built an irreplaceable rapport with quarterback Tom Brady over the last eight years. Raj Mehta/USA TODAY Sports\n\n\"We've played together for a long time, and I think there's great chemistry in what we're doing,\" Brady said. \"He's just an incredible player and teammate.\"\n\nEdelman was essentially the team's No. 1 receiver and Brady's go-to guy in got-to-have-it situations. His absence bumps Chris Hogan and Brandin Cooks up to the top two spots on the depth chart, with veteran Danny Amendola a capable and clutch No. 3 option. Second-year player Malcolm Mitchell is No. 4, but he's been slowed by knee trouble. His availability at this time remains an unknown.\n\nThe Patriots carefully manage Amendola’s playing time to limit his injury risk (he played 23.8 percent of the offensive snaps in 2016), but as Super Bowl LI showed, he is the closest to Edelman among receivers in terms of earning Brady's trust in clutch situations.\n\nThat's still a capable top of the receiver depth chart, and it doesn't even account for second-year receiver Devin Lucien and undrafted free agent Austin Carr, who could add depth (likely on the practice squad).\n\nMore people play on ESPN than anywhere else.

Foster could be part of filling the void. It wouldn't be a surprise if the Patriots use more two-running-back sets this season.\n\nAnd at tight end, Gronkowski and Dwayne Allen form a solid 1-2 punch.\n\n\"You never want to see a guy go down, especially a player like Julian, how hard he works,\" Gronkowski said after Friday's game. \"You just hope for the best for him.\"\n\nLast year Edelman took great pride in making it through the season healthy for every game. That was a goal of his after a broken bone in his foot knocked him out of the second half of the 2015 regular season.\n\nSo this is a tough blow for him and the Patriots. Everyone knows how valuable Edelman has been. At the same time, the offense has a history of overcoming such losses.\n\nJust as they won a Super Bowl without Gronkowski down the stretch last season, the Patriots are capable of making a similar run this year without Edelman.","author":"Mike ReissESPN Staff Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T09:15:29.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0825%2Fr249132_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"TGSuOZsAQgsHrjGTZTb25w==\n"}

Matthew Berry looks at Tate's numbers and why he is putting value on the star wide receiver's potential in the slot. (1:21)\n\nTwitter gives you 140 characters. Snapchat gives you 10 seconds. And if my kids are any indication, you get two seconds to impress on TV before they keep flipping. We are a short-attention-span, slideshow-worshipping, list-loving society. So in honor of that, it is an annual preseason tradition.\n\nThese are 10 lists ... of 10.\n\nList 1: 10 players who are not currently being drafted as starters in ESPN.com leagues (top 10 QB/TE or top 20 RB/WR) that I believe will finish as such\n\n1. Marcus Mariota, Tennessee Titans (current ADP: QB12): So you're telling me that the most efficient red zone quarterback (since he entered the NFL), who added the most efficient red zone receiver (in terms of PPR points per game since 2012) and was QB7 before he got hurt last season (Weeks 1-15), isn't being considered a fantasy starter? According to Tristan H. Cockcroft's Consistency Ratings, Mariota is joined by the second-most-consistent TE over the past three seasons, and Rishard Matthews is back in the fold after breaking out (WR22) in his first season with the Titans. Did I mention that the Titans used two top-75 picks on receivers? Or that they have an elite offensive line?\n\n2. Philip Rivers, Los Angeles Chargers (current ADP: QB17): I get there's nothing sexy or interesting about Rivers, but the guy always stays healthy and was QB14 last season throwing to no one. As I mentioned in Love/Hate this year, I am a Keenan Allen believer this year. And Rivers' career per-game numbers with Allen on the field are eye-popping. Over a 16-game stretch, you'd get 4,597 passing yards, 31 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Hunter Henry and Tyrell Williams emerged last season, plus Antonio Gates is back for another year and maybe they get something out of Mike Williams ... a lot of toys for Rivers to play with.\n\n3. Adrian Peterson, New Orleans Saints (current ADP: RB25): Well, he was going as RB31 a few days ago, but you spend 28 straight hours on TV talking a guy up apparently it helps his ADP. I get the \"he's old and an injury risk\" concern, but come on. He doesn't have to be his Hall of Fame self, he just needs to stay reasonably healthy. There are 247 non-Mark Ingram touches available from last season on a team that had 17 rushing touchdowns and the fourth-most rushing scores the past three seasons. He could fall into double-digit scores.\n\n4. Doug Martin, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (current ADP: RB37): Martin has looked good this preseason, we have certainly seen him do it before and I expect the Bucs' offense to take a major step forward this season. Combine Martin with RB48 Jacquizz Rodgers and you have the starting RB on a good offense for a 12th and a 14th, according to ESPN ADP. I love the price and the upside.\n\n5. Kareem Hunt, Kansas City Chiefs (current ADP: RB40): I expect his ADP to continually rise, and after the second preseason game that hype will continue. But I still don't think he'll get drafted inside the top 20, and I know the Chiefs love him. Hunt is a true three-down back I've written about a lot (and I'm not alone), and he has received good reviews in pass protection from Andy Reid. He'll be involved from day one and this will be his job sooner than later.\n\n6. Brandon Marshall, New York Giants (current ADP: WR 30): I could spit stats at you, like the fact that Marshall is the top-scoring fantasy receiver in the red zone since 2012 or that the Giants have dropped back to pass at the fourth-highest rate inside the red zone over the past two seasons. But after finishing as a top-three fantasy wideout in both his first year in Chicago and his first year with the Jets, I like Marshall's chances at a top-20 finish this season while playing with the best QB of his career.\n\n7. Martavis Bryant, Pittsburgh Steelers (current ADP: WR32): The upside is high. Like really high. Ben Roethlisberger led the NFL in deep touchdown passes last season, despite missing a pair of games, relying on 5-foot-10 Antonio Brown to stretch the field and with a trio of receivers in Markus Wheaton, Darrius Heyward-Bey and Sammie Coates combining to drop 10.4 percent of their targets (league WR average: 3.5 percent). Bryant has the physical tools to fill that role in a massive way and that's not just me saying that, we've seen it. In 2014-15, Bryant ranked fourth in air yards per target and third in yards per reception. The receiver pool is deep this season and that means that you have no excuse to not draft Bryant as a starter, as your replacement-level player will be plenty productive to offset the risk taken.\n\n8. Eric Decker, Tennessee Titans (current ADP: WR 38): Doubling down here ... if I'm going to be right on Mariota, it will be because his connection with Decker is as good as the numbers suggest. Since 2012, Decker has been among the most consistent wideouts in the NFL and is averaging 82 catches, 1,116 yards, and 10.6 touchdowns per 16 games. That's his average ... not his ceiling. The combination of high floor and ceiling is impossible to match at this point in the draft. Sign me up.\n\n9. Jack Doyle, Indianapolis Colts (current ADP: TE13): I've talked him up a ton this preseason. We got a glimpse of Doyle's upside in Weeks 1-7 last season (when he was fourth among TEs in fantasy points) and with Dwayne Allen no longer eating up the red zone looks, Doyle has tons of potential with a quarterback and offensive coordinator that both love to utilize the tight end.\n\n10. Austin Hooper, Atlanta Falcons (current ADP: TE20): As Matt Ryan got even more comfortable in Kyle Shanahan's offense last season and Alex Mack helped solidify the offensive line, a funny thing happened. The Falcons started using the tight ends, as they accounted for 10 scores, twice as many as they tallied the previous two seasons combined. I'm not sure Hooper gets all of that action, but there's no more Jacob Tamme, and after a Super Bowl in which Hooper scored a touchdown, he might not get to top 10, but he will easily beat his current ADP.\n\nList 2: Ten leftover stats from my \"100 Facts\" column, among my favorites to write every year\n\nThe departures of DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon mean that Jamison Crowder should be an even greater factor. Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports\n\n1. Jamison Crowder ranked fifth in fantasy points scored from the slot last season. Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson accounted for 47.9 percent of non-Crowder Redskins fantasy points from the slot last season and are no longer in Washington.\n\n2. Carson Wentz threw more passes than anyone in the second half of last season. The Eagles added Alshon Jeffery, Torrey Smith and get Lane Johnson back on the offensive line for the full season. His current ADP is QB16.\n\n3. Bilal Powell was fourth in running back receptions last season. And he ranked third in yards per carry AFTER first contact.\n\n4. In his first season with Sam Bradford, Kyle Rudolph caught 14 passes in the red zone. In the past five seasons, the only TEs with more such catches in a single season are Jimmy Graham, Jordan Reed and Tony Gonzalez.\n\n5. There were only four players in the league who saw more targets than T.Y. Hilton last season.\n\n5a. But there were 49 players who saw more looks in goal-to-go situations.\n\n6. The Broncos graded out 27th in pass protection, 30th (which means third highest) in off-target percentage and took fewer snaps than the average team last season. Demaryius Thomas still caught 90 balls for 1,083 yards and five scores (his fifth straight season reaching all of those thresholds) on his way to a WR16 finish in PPR leagues.\n\n7. During the past five seasons, no rookie TE has scored more PPR points than Tim Wright. Wright's 141.3 points as a rookie in 2013 would have ranked as TE15 last season. In theory, Evan Engram (TE14) and O.J. Howard (TE15) would have to produce the best season by a rookie TE since Rob Gronkowski in 2010 to make good on their ADPs.\n\n7a. Gronkowski produced 154.6 points as a rookie in 2010. That would have ranked as TE11 last season.\n\n8. During the past three years, the second-most-targeted Green Bay Packer is averaging 1,058 yards and 11 touchdowns per season.\n\n9. In the past two seasons, Tyler Eifert has missed 11 games. He still leads all tight ends in that time frame with 18 TDs. His current ADP is TE8.\n\n10. If you remove Julio Jones' 300-yard, 48-point game from Week 4 last season, he averaged 16.3 fantasy points per game (FPPG) in PPR last season in 13 games (he missed two because of injury). His 211.9 total points he scored outside of the 300-yard game would have ranked just ahead of WR22 Rishard Matthews' 211.5. If, instead of the 300-yard game, you gave Jones the 16.3 FPPG he averaged in the other 13 games, his 228.2 total points would have been just better than WR16 Demaryius Thomas (226.3). On a per-game basis, that 16.3 average would have ranked just ahead of WR9 Doug Baldwin's 15.85.\n\nList 3: Ten rookies I would take, in order, in dynasty leagues\n\n1.

Theo Riddick, Detroit Lions: Obvious, but going in Round 10 (90th overall).\n\n2. Duke Johnson Jr., Cleveland Browns: ADP will rise, but still a lot to like at 111th overall (12th round).\n\n3. James White, New England Patriots: Super Bowl hero was top three in RB receptions, targets and receiving yards. Going in Round 12 due to \"Patriots RB fears.\"\n\n4. C.J. Prosise, Seattle Seahawks: Needs to stay on the field, but there's no question about the talent or how Seattle wants to use him. Going in Round 14.\n\n5. Chris Thompson, Washington Redskins: A crucial part of Washington's passing offense. He finished strong last season, averaging more than 11 points a game in his final four. Going in Round 15.\n\n6. Shane Vereen, New York Giants: Forgotten after last year's injury-plagued season. He has a specific role on a pass-first offense and a reasonable path to significant playing time. Going undrafted.\n\n7. Alvin Kamara, New Orleans Saints: Already penciled in as Drew Brees' third-down back. He's a true three-down talent behind two veterans who have struggled with health in their careers.\n\n8. T.J. Yeldon, Jacksonville Jaguars: It's unlikely the Jags will have Leonard Fournette play on third downs initially, so Yeldon, who has caught 78.9 percent of his targets from Blake Bortles during his career (all other Jags have caught just 58.7 percent of his passes in that stretch), is the third-down beneficiary and basically free on draft day.\n\n9. Kyle Juszczyk, San Francisco 49ers: Juszczyk is a good pass-catcher, and he became the NFL's highest-paid fullback this offseason. After catching at least 37 balls in two straight seasons, he has been working out at tight end some and will absolutely have value this in deeper PPR leagues.\n\n10. Tarik Cohen, Chicago Bears: As mentioned by Chris Mortensen on \"The Fantasy Show\" earlier this week, the Bears like what they have in Cohen and he should see 8 to 12 touches a game in relief of Jordan Howard.\n\nList 6: Ten surprisingly consistent (or not) players, based on Tristan H. Cockcroft's consistency ratings\n\nAndrew Luck's questionable status for the start of the season has dropped his ADP to the point he could wind up as an incredible value in fantasy. Zach Bolinger/Icon Sportswire\n\n1. During the past three seasons, the Colts' Andrew Luck has been starter-worthy 52.1 percent of the time, the third-highest rate among quarterbacks. In that stretch, he has produced seven \"stud\" (top-two QB in a given week) performances and just four \"stiffs\" (outside the top 20 in a particular week) -- far and away the best rate in the NFL. Because of injury concerns, he's going in the ninth round.\n\n2. Todd Gurley didn't have a single \"stiff\" (outside the top 50 running backs) performance last season, something that might not seem like a major accomplishment, but DeMarco Murray, LeSean McCoy and Devonta Freeman were all credited with one last season. The Gurley is tied with McCoy for most games with 16-plus carries since he assumed the lead role in the Rams' backfield (Week 4 of 2015), and that volume gives him a nice floor, especially in a revamped offense under new coach Sean McVay.\n\n3. Tennessee's DeMarco Murray has quietly graded out as the most consistent running back not named Ezekiel Elliott over the past three years, and that says something given that he has been performing at such a high level (30.2 more PPR points and 58.2 more non-PPR points than any other running back in that span). That might be surprising considering he's played for three teams in that time frame, but he leads RBs in both top-fives (14) and top-25s (37) over that stretch.\n\n4. Murray's new Titans teammate, Eric Decker, has proved himself to be nothing short of an elite red zone option. Since 2014, Decker has more top-25 finishes and fewer finishes outside of the top 50 than fellow receiver A.J. Green despite, shall we say, inconsistent quarterback play. Now this red zone monster finds himself with the most efficient red zone QB since 2015.\n\n5. Despite missing 10 games and being banged up for other games, Rob Gronkowski has 13 top-two tight end finishes during the past three seasons. No other TE has more than seven. It might require patience during the week, but the advantage he gives you when active over the rest of the position is unlike anything else in fantasy football.\n\n6. Russell Wilson had four \"stiff\" performances (outside top 20 QBs) in 2014 and 2015 combined, but last season, he recorded a league-high seven! The Seahawks signal-caller had just five touchdown passes at the end of October, proceeded to throw five touchdowns during the next two weeks, followed that up with a four-game stretch that saw him fire three TDs and eight interceptions and promptly finished the season winning you your league (if you got there) with eight TD passes and one interception over the final three weeks. Quite a ride!\n\n7. Mark Ingram was not worth a spot in your starting lineup nine different times last season, and he had a pair of weeks in which he lost you your matchup with a finish outside the top 50 RBs. The downward-trending carry count is a bad sign for consistent production and with Adrian Peterson and Alvin Kamara joining the Saints' backfield, it is hard to consider Ingram a \"safe\" option, as some like to proclaim.\n\n8. Despite playing for one of the most consistent offenses in football and posting consistent annual numbers, new Patriots receiver Brandin Cooks is a tough one to get a handle on weekly. Last season, Kenny Stills actually had more top-25 WR finishes than Cooks, but Cooks also had as many top-five finishes as Odell Beckham Jr., Demaryius Thomas and Terrelle Pryor Sr. put together. Boom or bust last season, does the consistency pick up now that he is part of a juggernaut offense that is capable of featuring a different player each week, or will it suffer even more?\n\n9. In addition to questionable health, receiver Sammy Watkins has posted more weekly finishes outside of the top 50 (17) than he has inside of the top 25 over the past three seasons (15) and recently joined a team in the Rams headed by a second-year quarterback in Jared Goff, whose skill set doesn't seem to match Watkins' strengths.\n\n10. The Raiders' Amari Cooper had seven games last season in which he finished as a top-25 fantasy wide receiver but also had five games in which he finished outside the top 50.\n\nList 7: More team names suggested to me, this time by my followers on Twitter\n\nMatthew Berry's RotoPass Need help with customized ranks for your scoring system, lineup setting tools, season-long projections and in-season trades?

Odell, Motel, Golladay Ginn (@deanis19)\n\nList 8: Ten boring, old guys who won't elicit \"oohs\" when you draft them but who will be very solid and outperform their current ADP\n\n1. Philip Rivers, QB, Los Angeles Chargers (current ADP: QB18): He enters 2017 having posted four consecutive seasons with at least 4,200 passing yards and 29 passing touchdowns and should have a healthy Keenan Allen at receiver to help bolster those numbers.\n\n2. Carson Palmer, QB, Arizona Cardinals (current ADP: QB19): Can you list for me all of the quarterbacks over the past two seasons with more passing yards and more passing touchdowns than Palmer? Drew Brees and the aforementioned Rivers. That's it and that's all. With RB David Johnson wanting to catch 100 balls and Larry Fitzgerald (keep reading) continuing to do Larry Fitzgerald things at receiver, a now-healthy Palmer should finish closer to 2015's top five than last year's QB19 disaster.\n\n3. Danny Woodhead, RB, Baltimore Ravens (current ADP: RB19, sixth round): A hamstring injury should continue to lower his ADP and, yes, while there is certainly health risk, the 32-year-old enters a Ravens offense that not only lost its projected starting running back but one that also counted on its backfield for 26.9 percent of completions last season. Woodhead has a pair of 75-plus catch seasons on his résumé, and it wouldn't be shocking if he added a third in what appears to be a perfect match.\n\n4. Adrian Peterson, RB, New Orleans Saints (current ADP: RB25): With more than 200 non-Mark Ingram touches from last season available, the team that had 17 rushing touchdowns last season and Drew Brees as its quarterback should allow Peterson to run without seeing a bunch of eight-man fronts, as he has his entire career.\n\n5. Matt Forte, RB, New York Jets (current ADP: RB40): With not much else on the Jets roster, expect Forte to touch the ball a lot. As much as Bilal Powell? No, but the guy has never been worse than RB21 in fantasy, and now he's going as RB40 in the 12th round! He's not dead; he's just a Jet, which isn't the same thing, I promise. I did research.\n\n6. Brandon Marshall, WR, New York Giants (current ADP: WR32): Assuming his injury is nothing serious -- podcast fans know you can't teach 6-foot-5 -- the fact that the Giants rely on a pair of sub-6-foot receivers means Marshall should be called on often in both field-stretching situations and when in the red zone (where he happens to be the top-producing fantasy WR since 2012). The G-men love to spread out defenses with their three-receiver sets; good luck in man coverage against Marshall. Big bounce-back year coming for the veteran wideout.\n\n7. Pierre Garcon, WR, San Francisco 49ers (current ADP: WR33): I've written and spoken about him a lot, but after some early buzz, the interest seems to have cooled on the 31-year-old Garcon. I'm still a believer. He got the big deal because of two coaches fighting over him in the offseason: Former Redskins offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan and another former Redskins offensive coordinator Sean McVay. Garcon went with Shanahan, who gave him in excess of 180 targets in 2013 and will now force-feed him the ball once again in an offense that will need to throw a lot.\n\n8. Larry Fitzgerald, WR, Arizona Cardinals (current ADP: WR19): The date was Jan. 3, 2015. The Cardinals had just lost a playoff game to the Panthers with QB Ryan Lindley racking up all of 82 passing yards, and Fitzgerald was able to pull down just three of eight targets. After 11 great years, was his career over? He missed a pair of games and scored only two touchdowns that regular season -- the writing was on the wall. Well, all he has done since is rattle off the two highest catch totals of his career, ranking him behind only Antonio Brown and Julio Jones in receptions during that stretch. With some of the best hands in the NFL and a veteran QB at the helm, Fitz is an unsexy but proven PPR threat going in the fifth or sixth round.\n\n9. Mike Wallace, WR, Baltimore Ravens (current ADP: WR42): There are times when you think to yourself: No one is listening. I've been banging the table for the 31-year-old Wallace since May and yet his ADP continues to hover in the 40s (11th round). He has been a top-30 fantasy wideout in seven of his eight seasons in the NFL (including last season in Baltimore), and had the most targets last season of anyone still left on the team. More than 300 targets from last season are available, and just how many do you think Jeremy Maclin actually gets? If Joe Flacco is going to miss regular-season games, OK, I get it, but Wallace has a shot at 150 targets in his second year on the team that threw the ball the most the past two seasons. I like his chances to improve a little on last year's four touchdowns.\n\n10. Ted Ginn Jr., WR, New Orleans Saints (current ADP: WR55): Did you know Ginn is 32? Neither did I, but while podcast fans know Ginn by another name, the fact is this list is about older players who could help win you your league -- not a list of actually good football players. So, while there is a list of stuff Ginn does not do well, he is still legitimately fast. And now he goes to a QB who ranks first in completions, fourth in completion percentage and fourth in touchdowns on deep passes (15-plus air yards) over the past three seasons. In that span, the majority of Ginn's receiving touchdowns (eight out of 14) have come on such passes. He will absolutely beat that ADP, and I love him in \"best ball\" leagues this year.\n\nList 9: Ten games (plus seven more) that allow you to get a top-five fantasy QB out of picks in Rounds 11 and 12\n\nBen Roethlisberger has incredibly different splits between home and road games, so it may be wise to employ a tag-team approach at QB in fantasy. Shelley Lipton/Icon Sportswire\n\nOK, so you know Ben Roethlisberger (health, road splits) and Matthew Stafford (pace of play, outdoor splits) both made my \"hate\" list, but since that list has come out, both have seen their ADPs drop. Love/Hate is always about ADP, so if I were writing the list today, neither guy would be on it based on the current ADP. Stafford averages 19.89 points in his past 16 indoor games. Roethlisberger averages 23.96 points in his past 16 home games. So, if you blew off QB early and then drafted both of them in Rounds 11 and 12, you could do something like this with your lineup this season:\n\n1. Week 1: Stafford vs. Arizona\n\n2. Week 2: Roethlisberger vs. Minnesota\n\n3. Week 3: Stafford vs. Atlanta\n\n4. Week 4: Stafford at Minnesota (tough matchup but still indoors)\n\n5. Week 5: Roethlisberger vs. Jacksonville\n\n6. Week 6: Stafford at New Orleans\n\n7. Week 7: Roethlisberger vs. Cincinnati\n\n8. Week 8: Stafford vs. Pittsburgh\n\n9. Week 9: Stafford at Green Bay (he's averaging 19.56 points in his past four games at Lambeau Field)\n\n10. Week 10: Stafford vs. Cleveland\n\n11. Week 11: Roethlisberger vs. Tennessee\n\n12. Week 12: Roethlisberger vs. Green Bay\n\n13. Week 13: Joe Flacco vs. Detroit. (OK, so we have to veer off here. At this point, Stafford doesn't work, so you can either trade him or cut him for Flacco, who should be available, averages 39 percent more points at home, and the Lions defense was third worst against quarterbacks last season. I expect them to be a plus matchup again this year.)\n\n14. Week 14: Roethlisberger vs. Baltimore\n\n15. Week 15: Roethlisberger vs. New England\n\n16. Week 16: Flacco vs. Indianapolis\n\n17. Week 17: Roethlisberger vs. Cleveland\n\nIf you add up the per-game averages for Stafford in a dome the past 16 games, Stafford at Green Bay the past four years, Roethlisberger at home the past 16 games and Flacco's 17.43 points per game at home the past five years and divide by 17, you get a QB that should average 21.55 points a game. Last year, Tom Brady was QB3 averaging 21.55 points a game. Loosey-goosey math, and these are all just based on averages, but still -- interesting, no?\n\nList 10: Ten final team names\n\n1.

If they keep finding ways to win as they did against Leicester, they'll be tipped for the title.","title":"Man United's win vs. Leicester shows why they are serious title contenders","url":"http://www.espnfc.com/blog/the-match/60/post/3188632/manchester-united-show-vs-leicester-that-they-are-serious-title-contenders","text":"Man United made it a perfect three-for-three to start the Premier League season as they cruised past Leicester City.\n\nShaka Hislop says Man United's early season form is the best they've looked since being managed by Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nShaka Hislop says Man United's early season form is the best they've looked since being managed by Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nMan United made it a perfect three-for-three to start the Premier League season as they cruised past Leicester City.\n\nMANCHESTER, England -- As Manchester United's players loaded the penalty area for the corner kick that would break Leicester's resistance, Jose Mourinho wandered over to Craig Shakespeare and patted him on the back. Perhaps it was the continuation of a private joke with his opposite number; perhaps it was to signal his admiration at the constant touchline cajoling that had, by and large, done the trick during 70 minutes of mounting frustration for the home team.\n\nOr perhaps, somehow, Mourinho knew what was coming.\n\nWithin seconds Marcus Rashford had evaporated the nerves and most of the doubt, too. Nobody would cast this as United's finest performance but that would be beside the point. Last season they were drawing games like this. They would batter teams that set up at Old Trafford to snatch a draw only to come away shaking their heads, and it cost them a place in the top four. This time, though, their pressure brought a solution in the form of a 2-0 win and if that becomes a recurring theme, then United will be serious title contenders.\n\nManchester United Manchester United Leicester City Leicester City 2 0 FT Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\n\"We didn't have many matches last season where we played 90 minutes with the control we had today,\" Mourinho said in his post-match news conference. There were plenty where they failed to put defensive opponents to the sword, though, and when Romelu Lukaku missed from the penalty spot early in the second half, the mind turned to a prime example last March when Zlatan Ibrahimovic failed from the spot against 10-man Bournemouth in a 1-1 draw that was characteristic of United's ills.\n\nThis time around, there was never quite the sense that Lukaku's miss -- or, put more charitably, Kasper Schmeichel's fine save - would derail United. Mourinho noted that his team kept up the pressure in the immediate aftermath, avoiding the \"little collapse\" that such a disappointment can bring. While it did embolden Leicester enough for Riyad Mahrez to fire a couple of rare shots on goal, the United manager had a point. They were never seriously under the cosh and the impression was that further openings would come.\n\n\"Were Leicester dangerous against Arsenal [when they lost 4-3]? Yes,\" Mourinho observed. \"I watched that match three times. Were they dangerous against us? No, because of us.\"\n\nUnited have struggled for a clear pattern of play in recent years if we sideline Louis van Gaal's sterile possession football as an experiment that failed, but one appears to be emerging and it was the key to their dominance here.\n\nIts heartbeat is in the centre of midfield, an area where United have too often been bland but now look physically and technically imposing. Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba overwhelmed Wilfred Ndidi and Matty James on both counts; Ndidi is a particularly fine prospect but looked cowed here, shrinking in comparison to his counterparts and compounding a difficult afternoon by failing to pick up Rashford for the opener.\n\nMatic's stability gives Pogba the scope he needs to roam and create and in the first half, the France international found space for seven shots on goal of varying danger. There is more clarity to United's shape and style at the moment; there was also a better tempo with the ball than they displayed against massed defensive ranks during 2016-17. Anthony Martial produced a lively performance in his first start of the campaign and it was eventually enough to wear Leicester down.\n\nMan United didn't let a missed penalty stop them from rolling to victory vs. Leicester. It's title-winning stuff.\n\nAgainst that, it is fair to point out that that Plan A didn't work perfectly. Rashford was introduced for Juan Mata three minutes before his goal because his possession-based approach was waning in effectiveness and Mourinho wanted \"a runner with and without the ball\" to combine with Lukaku. Mourinho didn't even see Rashford score, having turned his attention from Shakespeare to the planned introduction of Jesse Lingard. Had he not been able to shuffle his pack so effectively it is conceivable that Leicester, marshaled by the outstanding Harry Maguire, would have held out.\n\n\"We knew we'd have to frustrate [Man United] coming here,\" said Shakespeare. \"For large chunks of the game, 70 to 75 minutes, we did: we frustrated and restricted. But the big moments, they capitalised on.\"\n\nThe latter point told the tale. A corner and a deflection -- regardless of whether or not Marouane Fellaini intended to score United's second -- are not sexy ways to win a football match but the best teams find different ways to get the job done. Mkhitaryan's flag kick delivery, his fifth assist of the season already, was exceptional and Rashford's clip past Schmeichel was unerring. It was not the exhilarating exploitation of space that eventually overwhelmed both West Ham and Swansea, mind you, but nobody who saw Leicester retreat ever deeper from kick-off could have expected it to be.\n\nEven if frayed edges remain, the feeling of gathering momentum at United is palpable. Mourinho knows well the benefits of a fast start and now wants everyone around him on board. His final piece of touchline theatre, within moments of Fellaini's goal, was to cup his ears and shrug his shoulders at the supporters in the stand behind him. The crowd was \"very quiet today,\" he complained afterwards.\n\nMaybe there have been a few too many false dawns at Old Trafford in the past half-decade to rouse Mourinho's public just yet, but the manner in which they have purred through the first three games suggests that United are creating something worth putting their weight behind.\n\nNick Ames is a football journalist who writes for ESPN FC on a range of topics.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59a1f36cd579a51254729e6a"},"description":"ESPN combat sports analysts Dan Rafael and Brett Okamoto broke down the boxing event of the year to determine whether McGregor or Mayweather has the upper hand. Their decision was unanimous.","title":"Breaking down the lopsided McGregor/Mayweather clash","url":"http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/20240194/breaking-mayweather-vs-mcgregor","text":"This story appears in ESPN The Magazine's August 21 Fighting Issue. Subscribe today!\n\nIt's the best boxer of his generation, Floyd Mayweather Jr. (49-0, 26 KOs), against a mixed-martial artist with no professional boxing record whatsoever, Conor McGregor. Who will emerge on top in the spectacle of the year? ESPN's boxing and MMA experts, Dan Rafael and Brett Okamoto, agree: it's going to be a looooooong night for the brawler from Dublin.\n\nDEFENSE\n\nDAN RAFAEL: Floyd Mayweather epitomizes the art of boxing: to hit and not get hit. At the time of his 2015 retirement, Mayweather owned a boxing-best plus-24.5 plus/minus rating, per CompuBox. He landed 43.4 percent of his punches, while opponents landed only 18.9 percent. Advantage: Floyd\n\nBRETT OKAMOTO: Conor McGregor's takedown defense is pretty good, but that won't help him here, will it? Frankly, striking defense is not what he's known for. According to FightMetric, McGregor has defended just 57 percent of strikes during his UFC career, worst of any current male champ. Advantage: Floyd\n\nENDURANCE\n\nD: Mayweather has only 26 knockouts in 49 fights, so he goes 12 rounds as easily as the rest of us breathe. He's breezed through 12 rounds in his past seven fights and 12 of his past 14. Since his 17th fight, every bout but one has been set for the championship distance. Advantage: Floyd\n\nB: One could easily argue McGregor is the most ferocious first-round fighter in MMA. He has finished about half of his pro bouts inside the opening round. As impressive as that is, it's a potential concern here. He has fought past the third round only once. Advantage: Floyd\n\nFloyd Mayweather Jr.'s speedy reflexes have historically made it difficult for opponents to connect punches. Here, Canelo Alvarez throws a jab at Mayweather during their 2013 bout. AP Photo/Eric Jamison\n\nDURABILITY\n\nD: Only a few times has Mayweather even been shaken, notably against Shane Mosley and Marcos Maidana. Officially, he's been knocked down only once, when the referee blew a call in a 2001 fight against Carlos Hernandez. Advantage: Floyd\n\nB: The Irishman has a beard on him, no doubt. Nate Diaz hit McGregor 166 times, and he didn't go down. The heavy-hitting Chad Mendes blasted him in 2015, but he wore it fine. He's not invincible, but he can take a punch. He's also the younger, bigger man in this matchup. Advantage: McGregor\n\nSPEED\n\nD: In his younger days, Mayweather was known as one of the fastest fighters in boxing with his hands and his feet. He's 40 now, but even in his final fight before retirement in 2015, Mayweather's speed and reflexes in throwing and avoiding punches remained elite. Advantage: Floyd\n\nB: McGregor is a gifted athlete, but his speed is by deception. After the Jose Aldo knockout, he famously said \"precision beats power, and timing beats speed.\" He doesn't have blazing hands and feet; he's fast because he lives in your head and already knows your next move. Advantage: Floyd\n\nPunch power is the one area where both our experts give Conor McGregor the edge. Here, he strikes Eddie Alvarez during the UFC 205 event last year. Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images\n\nPOWER\n\nD: If there's one area in which Mayweather is just a regular fighter, it's power. His KO rate is a middling 53 percent. He hasn't scored a KO since a controversial fourth-round stoppage of Victor Ortiz in 2011. But power has never been Mayweather's game and never will be. Advantage: McGregor\n\nB: In March, McGregor posted an Instagram photo of his left hand. The caption: \"This left hand made me millions.\" Yes, it did. More than 85 percent of his wins are by knockout. He won both of his UFC titles, plus a U.K.-based Cage Warriors championship, via knockout. Advantage: McGregor\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nD: Mayweather has seen it all. As a gifted amateur, he won a bronze medal in the 1996 Olympics after being robbed in the semifinals. As a pro, he's faced almost every big name of his time and done so in the crucible of the sport's biggest stage. Advantage: Floyd\n\nB: McGregor's fighting roots are in boxing, in Ireland's Crumlin Boxing Club. He's always had comfort in the pocket, which he credits to his amateur boxing. That said, he's agreed to rules vastly different from those in his own arena. He's also facing one of the best ever. Advantage: Floyd\n\nAND THE WINNER IS....\n\nD: Easy work for Mayweather, who'll see what McGregor has for a few rounds and then pick him apart. He'll get inside a tiring McGregor's wild shots and KO him in about Round 7.\n\nB: Pressure on Mayweather to win big plus McGregor's willingness to take chances should equal a rare Mayweather stoppage. Mayweather KO in the 11th round.","author":"Dan Rafael","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-14T11:57:00.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0614%2FMayweather_McGregor_Preview_15x9.jpg","digest":"U0g3AUQcLa+XLPy+i1LMCQ==\n"}

None of it matters, however, until Bortles takes the field against Houston on Sept. 10.\n\nThe Jaguars’ season -- as well as his time in Jacksonville -- depends on him proving he’s a better quarterback than he has been in the first three seasons of his career. And he knows it.\n\n“Hundred percent [confident that he’ll rebound],” Bortles said. “It was something that hasn’t happened. You try not to think about it. Obviously it’s kind of hard not to do, but you move on and want to carry on with your day and go through and focus on what you can control.\n\n“It kind of just shifts a little bit now.

Joe Robbins/Getty Images\n\nFor that to happen, though, Bortles has the same tasks ahead of him that he did when the offseason began. Make better decisions, be more accurate, stop turning the ball over. Those were all things that he wasn’t doing well in training camp, which led to Marrone benching him and opening the competition in the first place.\n\nBortles has the most turnovers (63) and second-most interceptions (51) in the NFL since he entered the league in 2014. He has thrown 69 touchdown passes, but only five have come with the Jaguars leading. He also has the same number of pick-sixes (11) as he does career victories (11) as a starter.\n\nAnd, according to ESPN Stats \u0026 Information, Bortles has the fourth-worst Total QBR since 2008 (46.4).\n\nSo unless Bortles can radically alter the way he’s played in his first three seasons, he’ll be given little leeway and Henne will be back on the field.\n\nMore people play on ESPN than anywhere else.

I think that we’ve set goals of what we want to get done and what we want to establish day to day, week to week, game to game, and I think those things have to be met.\n\n“And I think if those things are not met, then obviously you have to make a decision and get someone in there that gives you a better chance to win. That’s not going to change.”\n\nBortles at least knows that he has little margin for error, but whether that means he’ll tighten up or play better won’t be known until the season opener against the Texans.\n\n“You can sit there and say, ‘Well, it’s happened once already, it could happen again,’ and worry about that and kind of let that consume your thoughts, or you can say, ‘I’ve had to go through this once and there’s no way I’m going to ever let them do it to me again,’” Bortles said. “I’m going to go play as hard as I can. I’m going to do everything I can to help this team win and play as hard as I possibly can so I don’t have to go through that again.”","author":"Michael DiRoccoESPN Staff Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T19:00:35.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0824%2Fr248304_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"oI94WxlOgz8P3tPax3hSsA==\n"}

Using data to illuminate the weirdest superstition in video games Using data to illuminate the weirdest superstition in video games\n\nIn the 20-plus years of the Madden football game franchise, infamy has surrounded those selected to grace the annual football simulator’s cover. Since the San Francisco 49er’s Garrison Hearst broke his ankle after being named Madden ‘99’s cover athlete, rumors have circulated of a “curse.”\n\nThe “curse” grew in infamy as an ever-increasing numbers of Madden cover athletes suffered high-profile injuries: after being named to the Madden cover, Michael Vick broke his fibula during the 2003 preseason, while Vince Young, Troy Polamalu, and Shaun Alexander all lost time due to injury. Other cover athletes simply had terrible seasons compared to their normal successes: Drew Brees had a down year after his selection, and Marshall Faulk, usually so reliable, failed to pass 1,000 yards rushing. Now, fans are so superstitious about the curse that they actively campaign for their favorite player to not get selected for the cover.\n\nOf course, other publications and experts have weighed in and dismissed the Madden “curse” as nothing more than superstition. The drop off of players featured on the cover, so the argument goes, is due to two factors: 1) regression fallacy-- basically, people assume that players have regressed because of outside forces (the curse) instead of taking into consideration natural fluctuations in football. If a player does well one year, people expect they’ll play that well next year. 2) the spurious correlation between a player’s appearance and their statistical dropoff. Essentially, people attribute the cover selection and its curse as leading to a player having a bad season the following year.\n\nSo who is right? How do you even prove a curse exists?\n\nWe initially tried to consult occult experts to determine why there would be evil surrounding the cover of a video game series, but, unlike the billy goat’s curse that haunted the Cubs, we could find no compelling backstory to explain what diabolical forces Madden might have tapped into. So we turned to math.\n\nMeet Our Researcher\n\nWhile we can’t prove the existence of a curse, we hoped that a thorough look at the numbers would prove once and for all whether players who were selected for the cover were statistically more likely to have bad seasons the year after their selection. If cover selection = bad following year, then the numbers should show it. So we asked Nick Hatley, a research analyst out of Washington, DC, to help us build a mathematical model.\n\nUsing ESPN’s fantasy numbers, we gave each offensive player a numerical value per season-- incorporating things like touchdowns, yards, yards thrown, etc. For example, Tennessee Titans running back Eddie George accrued 1,509 yards rushing and 14 touchdowns in 2000, which translates to 342.2 points in our system. In the data below, using NFL records and ESPN’s numbers, we tracked each Madden cover athletes’ output over their careers.\n\nA quick note: Our fantasy-focused model has some limitations. We only included offensive athletes in our analysis because comparing offensive stats with defensive stats proved too clumsy. With only a handful of defensive players featured on the Madden cover, creating a combination model proved too unwieldy. Apologies to Richard Sherman.\n\nModel 1: MVPs Versus Madden Athletes\n\nFirst, we looked at the type of player who is selected for the Madden cover. These are, with few exceptions, some of the top players in the league. Drew Brees, Marshall Faulk, and now Tom Brady have all graced the cover. To illuminate whether or not players’ decline is simple regression of top talent, we compared the regression of Madden cover athletes with the regression of MVPs.\n\nBut in our research, players who received the MVP the year prior regressed more than Madden cover athletes. In other words, you were more likely to have a comparatively bad year after being an MVP than being a Madden athlete. Of course, “We don’t talk about the MVP curse,” Hatley explains. Why not? Players are selected for the cover when they’re likely at their peak, as the thinking goes, so they’re more likely to regress. MVPs and Madden cover athletes follow the same pattern, but Madden athletes didn’t even regress as much: Madden athletes declined by an average of 71.4 points the year after their cover year compared with an average decline of 91.8 points for MVPs.\n\n“ But in our research, players who received the MVP the prior year regressed more than Madden cover athletes.\n\nSo it looks like yes, the Madden curse can somewhat be attributed, in aggregate, to larger player regression trends. So the curse is disproved, right? Not so fast.\n\nModel 2: Madden Athletes Versus Top Ten Athletes\n\nMadden cover athletes are not just the top players in the league, but are often selected by fans for a variety of reasons. These players sometimes aren’t in the MVP conversation at all and may still be early in their careers. Peyton Hillis is a great example-- a running back whose career was on the upswing but by no means a dominant force in the league. The Madden cover looked like the start of a long successful career. Surely, players like Hillis won’t regress as much as players at their peak, right? Our model needs to take that into account.\n\nSo comparing Madden athletes to MVPs is too narrow. MVPs rarely repeat in the league, and are doomed to regress after their peak year. So what about comparing Madden athletes to a fantasy top ten performers at each position (QB, RB, WR)? This allows us to compare Madden players to a wider range of players that had a successful prior season.\n\nSurprisingly, in our model, Madden athletes experience a 24.5 point decrease more than a top ten player. To put it another way: compared with their previous season, a Madden athlete is more likely to have a worse year the next year being on the cover than a regular player coming off a top ten fantasy point season. To go back to our Hillis example, Hillis never achieved the heights of his pre-Madden cover season. Instead of being the mark of an up-and-coming player, he peaked and regressed.\n\nHillis’ case turned out to not be just an anecdote. The difference in a Madden player’s decline and a Top 10 position player's is statistically significant, Hatley explains, meaning it’s further away from random variance. So we can’t dismiss the curse outright as random chance. Madden athletes have worse dropoffs than the average top ten player. That’s strange.\n\nModel 3: The Missed Games Problem\n\nPerhaps the most high-profile aspect of the Madden curse is the perception that after getting awarded the cover, players are afflicted with bizarre and enduring injuries that costs them playing time. We would be remiss if we didn’t take that into account with our calculations.\n\nSo we compared how much time a player who had just achieved a top ten fantasy season averaged in missed games the next season compared to the missed games of a Madden athlete. But again, the curse didn’t hold up in our numbers: Madden cover athletes missed FEWER games on average the year after their selection than a top ten athlete.\n\nBut perhaps we’re again injecting bias into our model by comparing the high-profile injuries of Madden athletes to fellow athletes playing at a high level. So we decided to compare Madden cover athletes to the average player.\n\nSurprisingly, compared with an average NFL player, a Madden cover player misses a half a game more on average. That’s it. In our research, Madden cover players missed 1.2 games on average after being on the cover, and top ten players from the year before missed 1.57 games in their next years. For average players, they missed 0.79 games in the following year. It’s not looking good for the curse.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Madden Curse has captivated our interest because of several high profile incidents. Hillis never played another great season. Gronk got hurt. Hearst’s ankle didn’t hold up. But in aggregate, these strange seasons are given context. Football is a highly variable and injury prone sport. Our research doesn’t show a series of strange data points that can only be explained by the supernatural. Instead, it shows largely reversion to the mean.\n\n“ It’s not looking good for the curse.\n\nPlayers who are not injured for long periods of time (and therefore can accrue a large amount of stats) are likely to regress back to the norm. But that won’t stop people from attributing these regressions to other things. Indeed, the sport is rife with superstition that tries to explain these spurious correlations: wearing a particular color increases a chance of victory, just as not following the unwritten rules of a sport will likely lead to a “curse.”\n\nWe set out to prove or disprove evidence of the curse, and our verdict is mixed. While Madden cover athletes don’t regress more than MVPs, our research predicts that they’ll have, on average, worse seasons compared with the year before than other top tier players-- even if they don’t miss as much playing time. If that’s enough for you to believe in a curse, maybe don’t draft Tom Brady in your fantasy league.\n\nChristian Holt is IGN's Custom Content Editor.

One of them is Dark Souls, because obviously. One of them is Dark Souls, because obviously.\n\nHe is the wild blue yonder. The front line in a never-ending battle between good and not-so-good. He is The Tick, and now, he’s played by low-key comedy genius Peter Serafinowicz in Amazon’s new live-action series.\n\nFor fans of older iterations of the satirical blue superhero, it may be difficult to envision the British actor, whose recognition this side of the pond isn’t quite where it deserves to be, in the same shoes as Patrick Warburton, whose pitch-perfect cartoonish take on the character made the tragically short-lived tv show a cult favorite (and worthy successor to the 1994 animated series, featuring Townsend Coleman as the voice of the titular hero).\n\nAs discussed in IGN's review of The Tick, Amazon’s take on the show looks to be just as irreverent and surreally hilarious as the story has always required, but with a slightly grimmer edge. But lest you worry this is just the latest attempt to grab cash by ramping up the violence of a comic book story, or that Serafinowicz couldn’t possibly measure up to Warburton’s timeless turn as The Tick, ahead we’ve got irrefutable proof that the British comedy veteran has got what it takes to pound two-fisted justice into the hearts of evildoers everywhere.\n\nMost of these reasons discuss old shows, films and movies, but a few (particularly People of Earth are more recent), so beware of SPOILERS.\n\nFall TV 2017 Guide to Remakes and Adaptations 10+ IMAGES Fullscreen Image Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC 01 OF 14 Star Trek: Discovery\n\nCBS All Access\n\nPremieres: Sunday, Sept. 24\n\nThe latest addition to Gene Roddenbery's legacy is a new series created by Bryan Fuller and Alex Kurtzman that follows the crew of the USS Discovery a decade before the events of the original series.\n\n\"We are going to cross paths with components that Trek fans are familiar with, but it is its own standalone story with its own characters and its own unique vision of Trek,\" executive producer Akiva Goldsman said of the series. 01 OF 14 Star Trek: Discovery\n\nCBS All Access\n\nPremieres: Sunday, Sept. 24\n\nThe latest addition to Gene Roddenbery's legacy is a new series created by Bryan Fuller and Alex Kurtzman that follows the crew of the USS Discovery a decade before the events of the original series.\n\n\"We are going to cross paths with components that Trek fans are familiar with, but it is its own standalone story with its own characters and its own unique vision of Trek,\" executive producer Akiva Goldsman said of the series. Fall TV 2017 Guide to Remakes and Adaptations Download Image Captions ESC\n\n1. Look Around You (2002)\n\nThe Tick, created by Ben Edlund in 1986 as a mascot for Boston-area comic shop chain New England Comics, is a spoof of American comic book heroes. If Watchmen had taken itself way, way, waaaay less seriously (or The Incredibles moreso) we would probably end up with some similar bits of commentary about superheroes causing gigantic amounts of damage while saving cities from villains as we get from The Tick. Luckily for us, Serafinowicz is no stranger to straight-faced, absurdist satire.\n\nThe BAFTA-nominated series Look Around You, written and created by Serafinowicz and Robert Popper, ran on BBC2 in 2002 and 2005. It was a spoof of 1970’s/1980’s era educational programs often shown in public schools. It’s formatted as a science and discovery show, featuring nonsensical experiments done on-camera with made-up lab equipment and using era-authentic 16mm film. For a taste of the classically dry British comedic satire, check out this clip (featuring none other than Edgar Wright as a scientist):\n\n2. Shaun of the Dead (2004)\n\nSpeaking of Edgar Wright, here’s another example of Serafinowicz killing it (pun intended) in a satirical project that nails and celebrates the tropes of its genre, in this case, zombie horror. While Serafinowicz, as uptight straight-man Pete, doesn’t get the chance to flex his comedic chops nearly to the degree that Simon Pegg and Nick Frost do (the “f**k-a-doodle-do” line and censored edition of “go live in the shed, you thick funk!” notwithstanding), he does manage to be a spectacularly frightening zombie while looming over Shaun in the bathroom.\n\nAnd his hair-trigger, beleaguered temperament while still alive, which we only really see on display during his small amount of screen-time at the start of the film, lingers such that his flatmates are almost too afraid to steal his car even after he’s died and joined the ranks of the undead. The sinister edge he lent the short-lived Pete will definitely serve the slightly darker updated Tick in Amazon’s series. If, like us, you obsessively watched every single DVD extra on Shaun of the Dead as teenagers, then you were also treated to this Beatles version of the kitchen argument between Pete and Shaun:\n\n3. The Peter Serafinowicz Show (2007)\n\nThough it only ran for seven episodes, the sketch-comedy series helmed by Peter Serafinowicz (along with Robert Popper, again) demonstrates the maniac-levels of commitment the newest Tick is capable of delivering to absurd comedic premises. Serafinowicz carried this devotion so far that, when the series was cancelled, he issued a mock BBC interview on YouTube claiming to have left the show by choice, because he was \"unhappy with the BBC's decision to not recommission the series.\"\n\nThe show was essentially a platform for the actor’s myriad celebrity impressions, from each one of the Beatles to Kevin Spacey, as well as original characters like the cult favorite nonsensical salesman Brian Butterfield. Though the list of laugh-out-loud sketches is impressively long for such a short-lived show, by far one of the best is “Darth Vader in Love,” which makes excellent use of both Serafinowicz’s voice acting skills, and surprisingly original mouth-breathing gimmicks:\n\n4. Dark Souls 2 (2014)\n\nThe immensely popular action role-playing game Dark Souls II boasted a more powerful graphics engine and advanced AI system than the first installment, and earned acclaim from a number of critics (including our own Marty Silva, who scored it 9 out of 10). Peter Serafinowicz had been such an avowed superfan of the first Dark Souls (fun fact: he’s called the Souls series a cross between Zelda and Resident Evil 4) that he wanted the chance to do voicework in the sequel, having already experienced videogame voice acting with roles in Warhammer 40,000: Fire Warrior and Lego City Undercover.\n\nIn Dark Souls 2, he helped transcend Mild-Mannered Pate into a notable, standout NPC. In an interview with Vice, Serafinowicz said of his own character, “There are so many things that are oblique. Not even I know, truly, what Pate's intentions were.\" Serafinowicz has done plenty of voice acting for games, but his role in Dark Souls II showcases perfectly how his involvement in a property helps elevate a character.\n\n5. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)\n\nIn his small but memorable role as Denarian Saal of Nova Corps in Guardians of the Galaxy, Serafinowicz demonstrated a similar, if far more straight-faced, single-minded pursuit of justice to that of The Tick. Here, it’s the same aggressively serious mannerisms which made the pre-zombified Pete so easy to laugh at (nervous laughter, at least) in Shaun of the Dead that make Saal an effective foil for his bumbling partner, Corpsman Dey (played by John C. Reilly). Though his character is killed in the battle on Xandar, there’s always the slight possibility that we’ll see Saal again, if the storyline from the comic books is taken into account. Just watch how he steals the show (and became the go-to quote for the movie) based on the first trailer:\n\n6. People of Earth (2016)\n\nOne of Serafinowicz’s most recent roles is that of Eric, the floating sentient cube on TBS’s subtly dark, offbeat alien abduction comedy series People of Earth. We meet Eric right at the end of Season 1/the opening of Season 2, when he/it is revealed as the new boss in charge of the alien invasion of Earth. To give a memorable voice performance as a tiny, nearly featureless box is no easy feat, but Serafinowicz pulls it off remarkably. The character speaks in a blandly unidentifiable accent, and constantly uses an upbeat tone that almost covers the implied threat of lines like “Work can be fun, especially when we work together.”\n\nEric betrays almost no emotion, but his mysterious seizure of command over the substation and ability to scan living beings for information about their emotions and secrets leave much of his true intentions to the imagination, and none of it good. Serafinowicz’s impressive ability to pull all this off in brief, robotic lines points again to the possibility that this newest Tick may have more going on beneath the blue armor than a simple blind devotion to justice. In lieu of available Eric the Cube clips, please enjoy this instructional video for aliens, made by “The Visitors for Human Collaborators on Edité-Frignim (Earth)” (Peter Serafinowicz and Robert Popper again, 2013).\n\nDo you think Serafinowicz is as worthy of his moment as we do?

It turns out the reason is pretty simple: “Why not?”\n\n“Todd Vaughn our VP of Development and I had talked about it and sort of kicked around this idea,” Hines told me. “Last year I think we had reduced it to like 99 cents [during a sale], and we were like ‘why don’t we just make it free? Like, why not?’”\n\n“Just make it free and let people download it, and maybe they’ll buy the DLC and maybe they won’t, but let’s just try it.” Hines continued by saying “The game has been out for forever, how much money are we really making off a 99 cents [sale]?”\n\nHines said they decided to “just put it out free and see if people like it and people play it.” Since becoming free-to-play, Brink has seen a significant (if still modest) surge in its player base, hitting a peak of 2,600 concurrent players the day after the change was made.\n\nBrink wasn’t very well received at launch (you can watch our review above, or read it here), but Hines thinks it was left it in a better state than people remember. “It had its issues back when it first launched,” Hines explained, “but I think we updated it and got it to the point where it was fun and stable.”\n\nHines concluded by saying “I like trying stuff, I like catching people off guard… It’s QuakeCon, we do fun stuff around QuakeCon.”\n\nTom Marks is an Associate Editor focusing on PC gaming at IGN.

I update that page immediately when they come in stock.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nI wrote up a preorder guide breaking out where to order and which vendors offer what freebies and discounts. Check it out!\n\nToday's New Deals\n\nHere's a rare OLED HDTV deal. This TV currently sells for $1800 on Amazon and most other vendors. OLED TVs offer unprecedented black levels and feature true HDR compatibility.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThis was a surprise hit during E3 and is shaping up to be a must-own title for the Switch. It features great Nintendo-style graphics with tactical RPG gameplay that looks like a mix of XCOM and Super Mario RPG. If you're ordering from Amazon, Monday is the last day you can take advantage of the 20% off discount with Prime.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThis limited edition mystery crate features exclusive Stranger Things apparel, collectibles and more from Seasons 1 and 2. Because this crate contains Season 2-specific items, it won't ship until the global premiere of Season 2 on Netflix (October 27).\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThese deals last for today only. Some great deals to be found here. Anker is one of the best known and well-rated brands of power banks out there.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nInexpensive tablet for back to school. Features a high-quality IPS panel display, 8GB of internal storage, and up to 8 hours of battery life.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nHefty price drop for this very popular, well-rated, and versatile mini tripod mount. It includes a clamp-type adapter for mounting large smartphones. However, you can also unscrew the adapter and use it as a regular tripod for something like a GoPro (this tripod is too small for a DSLR).\n\n-----------------------------\n\nEven if you don't have an avaiable wall outlet, you can still charge this guy up with solar power or your own kinetic energy. It features an AM/FM/NOAA radio, LED flashlight, 1000mAh power bank, and only weighs 8 ounces.\n\nUse code \"3GIT5N5U\" to get it from Amazon for $40\n\n-----------------------------\n\nGreat price, considering the newest model (Charge 3) costs almost double the price. The difference? The Charge 2+ is splashproof and the Charge 3 is waterproof. If that doesn't tick an important checkbox in your book, save the money and get this model.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nIf you've preordered or are planning to get the Galaxy Note 8, don't scratch it up on day 1. These cases cost a measly $2 and provide drop and scratch protection for your $930+ phone.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nAlready get 44% off the PC edition, and it hasn't been released yet. Includes gameplay updates, graphical enhancements, the ability to play mods for free on PC and consoles, and all six add-ons: Automatron, Wasteland Workshop, Far Harbor, Contraptions Workshop, Vault-Tec Workshop, and Nuka-World.\n\n-----------------------------\n\n-----------------------------\n\nHere's an odd deal. Spend $25 on Amazon - can be anything, not just vitamins - and get one free Amazon Elements Vitamins and Supplements of your choice listed on this page (make sure to apply code: \"PRIMEVITAMIN\"). Most items work including video games, but preorders are ineligible.\n\nUse code \"PRIMEVITAMIN\" and spend $25 on Amazon to get Vitamins\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThese TVs sell for retail price elsewhere, so the gift card is FREE MONEY. Gift card is emailed within 20 days and has a 90-day expiration.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThe BB-8 can move 3 ways - autonomously, with arm gestures using the Force Band, and via an app on your smartphone. Like the droid in the movie, BB-8's head will \"magically\" (aka magnetically) always stay in the right place.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThis is the most popular consumer SSD on the market, and for good reason. It's fast, it's reliable, and it's very reasonably priced for an SSD. This drive will decrease boot and loading times in your PC or PS4 (also an Xbox One but swapping the internal drive requires a bit more work).\n\nThis Week's Popular Deals\n\nFor Playstation 4 players, the CoD: WWII beta runs from 8/25-8/28 and is reserved for people who preorder the game. If you're interested in getting the game preorder the game now so you can play the beta and cancel afterwards if you don't like it. Cancelling the preorder is easy and you will never get charged until the game ships out in November.\n\nThe Xbox One beta will start 9/1 and the PC beta in November.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nCan't get much cheaper for a 55\" 4K HDTV with smart functionality. This TV has over 400 user reviews on Amazon with a great 84% rating.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nFinding a GTX 1080 Ti at list price ($699.99) is difficult, and this one is discounted a little bit more. The Aorus is also overclocked out of the box and features a superior 3-fan aftermarket cooler.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThe Cowins are massively popular with the IGN audience. I've bought one myself out of curiosity and my wife now uses it all the time for work. I've had IGN staff buy one and then buy more for their friends and family. For $37 you're getting a headphone with 40mm large aperture drivers, wireless Bluetooth connectivity, active (not passive) noise cancellation, 30hrs of battery life, and built-in mic.\n\nUse code \" 42YFK63R \" to get these Headphones from Amazon for $38\n\n\" to get these Headphones from Amazon for $38 If that doesnt work, use code \"AU2KA5OO\" to get it for $39\n\n-----------------------------\n\nYou can combine this gift card discount with the Xbox video game sales that Microsoft hosts every week to get the best bang for your buck. The digital card will be sent to your inbox usually within 24 hours.\n\nNote: You can use Xbox Credit to purchase hardware, like the Minecraft Special Edition Xbox One S or the Xbox One X.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThis is a great looking backpack ideal for back to school. Features 840D and 800D twisted poly material in a heather finish, padded laptop and tablet comparts, and the ability to be carried as either a backpack or a brief. There's also a lifetime warranty.\n\nUse code \"9X364AZP\" to get it from Amazon for $64\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThis is one of the best power banks you can get and at a sweet price (I just bought one myself).

The PowerCore Elite has two Micro USB inputs for double the charging speed. It also has three outputs for charging up to 3 devices at a whopping 6A (or 2A each simultaneously).\n\nUse code \"ANK20AH3\" to get it from Amazon for $33\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThis is a complete overhaul of Monopoly, with customized game board, cards, money, tokens, even rules (probably, if you're winning, or you're nice, or you're just playing the game, then you automatically die).\n\n-----------------------------\n\nPretty sweet reskin of this classic board game at a very low price. Everything, from the game board to the monopoly money has been overhauled.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nIf you \"like\" CDKeys on Facebook, you get an instant one-time-use 5% off coupon code that drops the price to $43.70. You can knock CDKeys all you like but they ROCK for cheap Xbox Live Gold deals.\n\nIf you have an Xbox Live Gold membership, you'll also get great weekly deals on games at the Xbox Store. Get additional savings on these games:\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThe Switch alone still sells for up to $400 from scalpers on eBay. For the same price, you might as well get some extra stuff including one or two must-have titles. Bundles also prevent scalpers from buying additional stock (they can't really make money off bundles).\n\n-----------------------------\n\nFor storage that you can carry around, portable hard drives are easily the best value. They are small enough to fit in a pocket and yet hold boast way more capacity per dollar than USB flash drives. Best of all, there's no need to lug around an extra power brick. Compatible with PS4 and Xbox One.\n\nThe Best PC Deals\n\nYou can also upgrade to the GTX 1080 in the options (add $100 to the price). Other specs aren't too shabby either - latest generation Intel Core i7-7700 quad-core processor, a whopping 16GB of RAM, and a 2TB hard drive.\n\nUse code \"TENOFF\" to get it from Dell for $1260\n\nto get it from Dell for $1260 Upgrade to the GTX 1080 for an additional $100 ($130)\n\n-----------------------------\n\nDell Inspiron 15 5000 Intel Core i7 15\" 512GB SSD Laptop for $579\n\nFeatures a 15.6\" 720p display, latest generation Intel Core i7-7500 dual-core processor, 8GB RAM, massive 512GB SSD, and Windows 10 Pro.\n\nCode \"SAVEONINSP15\" to get this Dell Laptop for $579\n\n20% off Upcoming and New Release Games with Amazon Prime or Best Buy GCU\n\nThe PC version actually comes out a little later, on October 24.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nOut 9/6 - Playstation 4 Pro 1TB Limited Edition Destiny Bundle for $450\n\nNow available for preorder on Amazon and at Gamestop.

The first delivery comes with a figure, hoodie, and a piece of a Power Armor build-a-figure that combines with pieces from future Fallout crates.

Maester Hypemon says this would be so. Maester Hypemon says this would be so.\n\nGame of Thrones is already closing in on its Season 7 finale, and the promo for next week's episode is doing a good job of setting up a popular fan theory coming to life.\n\nFull spoilers for Game of Thrones' latest episode, \"Beyond the Wall,\" continue below.\n\nJon Snow has his wight, Daenerys Targaryen is firmly anti-Night King, and almost everyone on Game of Thrones is heading south to King's Landing. Almost everyone, it seems, including Sandor Clegane. (Not Sansa, though. She's still at Winterfell.)\n\nGame of Thrones: \"The Dragon and the Wolf\" Photos 9 IMAGES Fullscreen Image Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC 01 OF 9 Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark 01 OF 9 Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark Game of Thrones: \"The Dragon and the Wolf\" Photos HBO Download Image Captions ESC\n\nThe promo for the Season 7 finale of Game of Thrones is setting up Daenerys Targaryen bringing all of her forces to King's Landing, plus the Magnificent Six Five who came back from their ranging mission north of the Wall. Grey Worm, the Dothraki and the rest of the Team Dany crew line up outside of King's Landing, and Jon Snow and crew arrive to try to court Cersei to not fight the wars inside Westeros. But we all know Cersei isn't so quick to accept logic.\n\nJaime and Cersei Lannister have now had two episodes to think about how they should respond to Daenerys Targaryen's arrival, and we know that Cersei will always \"choose violence\" when given the option. So why wouldn't she default on the go-to Westeros way and make her decision based on a trial by combat? That certainly looks like the type of showdown the promo is setting up.\n\nOn its own, this doesn't tell us much, but these scenes align with one mysterious scene from the trailers that we haven't gotten context for. A scene that looks a lot like the Hound (who notably isn't spotted in this promo, despite everyone from Jorah to Jon to Davos being present) wielding a weapon on a platform that looks a heck of a lot like the one viewed in this promo.\n\nSo why is this important? Because if Cersei demands a trial by combat, we know exactly who she will be summoning to fight for her: Zombie Mountain, aka Ser Robert Strong, aka Gregor Clegane, the brother of the Hound.\n\nAnd people have been wanting these two to fight for years. Proof of the need for Cleganebowl, if you don't believe us:\n\nThe premise of the Cleganebowl theory is pretty simple: the Hound and the Mountain will fight each other in a brutal showdown. Given the ripe dramatic history they have together, it makes perfect sense that this would one day come to pass should both of these characters still be alive and in the same place, which they (mostly) will be.\n\nGame of Thrones has been delivering plenty of fan-desired moments, from Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen finally meeting to the Night King resurrecting a zombie dragon. Heck, they've all-but confirmed Jon Snow is actually a certain equation come to life (*cough* R+L=J). So while they're at it, why not make Cleganebowl happen while we're in Season 7?\n\nStill, there are plenty of popular fan theories still out there. That's why we asked the cast to grade them on an IGN scale of 1 to 10. Hear their favorites in the video below:\n\nDo you want Cleganebowl to happen?

See the answers to each of them below. Some of these puzzles (like the shadow puzzle) can be solved in various ways. We've tried to provide the easiest solution.\n\nIf you've found a faster or better way to solve a puzzle, add tips for your solution to this page or let us know in the comments below.\n\nEditChapter 4's Jumping Puzzles\n\n\n\nWhile in the Axe fortress, Chloe and Nadine come across three jumping puzzles. Make a wrong move and Chloe is knocked off the pillar. The key is to make sure the statues swing their weapons when you're out of the way. That way you can safely pass in front of them while they're winding up.\n\nHere's the path for the first jumping puzzle:\n\nForward, forward, right, left, forward, back, forward, left, forward, forward.\n\nAnd then for the second jumping puzzle:\n\nForward, right, left, forward, left, forward, left, right, forward, forward.\n\nAnd the solution for the third and final jumping puzzle:\n\nForward, forward, right, left, right, right, forward, right, forward, right, forward, left, left, right, forward, left, forward.\n\nEditChapter 5's Shadow Puzzle\n\nChloe needs to lineup the shadows with the images on the walls. On the left is Shiva, the axe, and Parashurama. On the right is Parashurama, Ganesh’s severed tusk, and Ganesh.\n\nThe 3x3 grid has four pieces on it that you must align properly in order to open the door. The distance from the wall is equally as important as the subject’s placement. Use the images below to solve the puzzle in eight simple steps.\n\nThe two black bars in the images below indicate the positions of the two images on the wall. The letters stand for the pieces on the board:\n\nS = Shiva\n\nP = Parashurama\n\nG = Ganesh\n\nA = Axe/Tusk\n\nMove 1: From the starting position, you want to move the Ganesh piece toward the Axe using the lever close to the painting that depicts Ganesh's tusk being cut off.\n\nMove 2 and 3: Push the Axe piece toward the Shiva piece using the lever closer to the entrance on the right. Then, push both the Axe and Parashurama pieces toward the tusk chopping painting by using the middle lever on the left side nearest the entrance to the room.\n\nMove 4 and 5: Push the Parashurama piece down away from the axe gifting painting so that it's next to Ganesh. Then, push the Ganesh and Parashurama pieces toward the entrance corner with the bottom lever by the tusk chopping painting.\n\nMove 6 and 7: Push the Shiva piece toward Ganesh. Then, push the Ganesh and Parashurama pieces to the right back toward the tusk chopping painting.\n\nMove 8: For the final move, push the Parashurama piece back toward the axe gifting painting to complete the puzzle.\n\nEditChapter 7's Disk Puzzle\n\n\n\nAfter Chloe turns the disk in the podium, activate the puzzle parts by pulling the two levers that appear on either side of the door. Doing so opens a third panel above the door. Go back to the disk and you'll be able to rotate the puzzle.\n\nUnlike the fortress puzzles, this puzzle has five layers. Here's what you need to do to solve it.\n\nLine up the first layer with the background. Then, line up the second layer with the first.\n\nWhen you get to the third layer you'll see that it rotates the two layers before it. Line them up.\n\nMoving on, line up the fourth layer. This one won't rotate any other disks.\n\nThe final, innermost layer moves the two layers before it. Even though it breaks up the progress you have thus far, you'll want to line up the innermost layer with layers three and four.\n\nCycle back through the layers until you get to layer three. Keep turning this layer until it lines up with layers one and two.\n\nAt this point all the disks should be aligned, but not with the background. Cycle through the layers back to the first and turn the image until it lines up with the background.\n\nWith the image completed, Chloe has one more task to complete. You need to move Ganesh into a yielding position. Move all of Ganesh's limbs to their lowest, most open positions. With Ganesh yielding, you can submit the puzzle.\n\nParashurama's axe comes down, but stops right before it would have hit Chloe. The platform before her transforms to reveal the tusk of Ganesh. Chloe is held back as Asav retrieves the tusk.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T22:04:31.000Z"},"source":"ign","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/05/27/contentplaceholderpng-967b4c.png","digest":"tJU7bhNwDbKvFAzoPBpfpQ==\n"}

The smartphone was revealed with much fanfare..","title":"Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 seems like the dream of the phablet realized","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/samsungs-galaxy-note-8-seems-like-the-dream-of-the-phablet-realized/","text":"The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is nearly here, with general availability set for September 15 and pre-orders on now. The smartphone was revealed with much fanfare during an event in NYC on Thursday, and Samsung drew particular attention to its new optically stabilized dual-camera system and improved S Pen stylus as the features that set it apart from the similar Galaxy S8 and S8+.\n\nThe Note 8’s big difference, however, based on what little time I got to spend with it so far at a hands-on event, is that it’s a truly manageable big-screen smartphone. The Note line basically created the ‘phablet’ category, and though the term itself has largely fallen out of use over the years (a lot of flagship phones now classify as phablets in terms of screen size), the Note 8 seems like the first time real balance has been achieved between offering a massive display combined with a comfortably handheld device.\n\nI was already a pretty big fan of the Samsung Galaxy S8+ and what the company was able to do with striking a balance between usability and a large display there, but the Note 8 feels like an even better balancing act in this regard. It has a 6.3-inch display, which is quite a bit larger than the 5.7-inch one on the Galaxy Note 5 (remember Samsung skipped ‘6’ and the 7… well the 7 didn’t work out). It also manages to shave 0.4 inches off the height of the device, as well as 0.04 inches off the depth (with the same width) and though it doesn’t sound like much, it makes a big difference when the phone’s in your hand, combined with the ounce or so of weight savings.\n\nSamsung’s Note 8 also comes with more pragmatic rectangular lines, vs. the pebble-like curves of the S8 line. It’s mostly an aesthetic difference, but it’s also something that makes the display on the Note 8 really pop. It genuinely feels like you’re holding a screen in your hand, with the thin top and bottom bezels virtually fading away during most tasks, including watching video and browsing the web. Speaking of browsing the web, this is likely going to be my favorite device for reading huge chunks of text, since that long column screen means lots of room for words, which is the only thing I love obviously as an internet blogger.\n\nThe S Pen is another contributing factor here in terms of fulfilling an early vision that Samsung had and stuck with, even through what seemed to me a few awkward early years. Using the new S Pen to write notes on the always-on AMOLED display feels like a great tool for quickly jotting things down (and for looking like you’re paying attention during a meeting instead of messing around on your phone). Plus, the translation trick is cool. Live Messages seem a bit gimmicky to truly stick, but as with most Samsung flashy features, it’s not doing any harm there even if most people ignore it.\n\nAnother highlight for me is the camera, which performed very well in my short time with the device. The Live Focus feature is really cool, letting you adjust the level of background blur both on the fly before you shoot, and after the fact in the resulting image. It uses both cameras to simulate the depth effect, as does Apple’s Portrait Mode, but it’s nice being able to adjust the level of DoF in detail. Photo-taking is also key on the Note 8 because it’s a much better mobile photo editing device, thanks to its phablet nature.\n\nSamsung-Galaxy-Note-8-camera Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Live Focus Samsung Galaxy Note 8 memo View Slideshow Previous Next Exit\n\nThe big difference here between the Note 8 and past generations in terms of phablet success, however, is still its ability to feel like a normal phone. That might be a bit of reverse conditioning, since flagships have gotten larger and larger, and the iPhone 7 Plus I currently use as my main device is really quite hefty thanks to large bezels surrounding that 5.5-inch display. And I’ll also add the caveat that I’ve got pretty beefy mitts, so your mileage may vary, but the Note 8 feels like it could be the true flagship of the Samsung line, rather than the interesting outlier the Note once was.\n\nAs mentioned, I’ve only had a very short time with the Galaxy Note 8, but what I’ve seen so far has me interested to take it for a longer spin. For the first time, however, it looks like bigger actually is unquestionably better when it comes to Samsung’s smartphone lineup.","author":"Darrell Etherington","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-25T18:36:29.000Z"},"source":"techcrunch","urlToImage":"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/samsung-galaxy-note-8-5.jpg","digest":"ZOQRtuqarm8TaO5lGIFP4Q==\n"}

(It intends to raise this again at the end of summer but only slightly, to $499.)\n\nIt seems unlikely the pair were slashing prices because potential customers might be too busily distracted by the looming total eclipse of the actual sun to think about buying into virtual reality.\n\nAs TechCrunch’s Lucas Matney noted: “Over the past several months it’s become clear that the war is no longer HTC and Oculus trying to discover who is Betamax and who is VHS, now they’re just trying to ensure that high-end VR doesn’t turn out to be LaserDisc. Though few of the big players are keen to readily admit it, many investors and analysts have been less than thrilled with the pace of headset sales over the past year.”\n\nThe bald fact that neither HTC nor Facebook/Oculus has released sales figures for their respective VR headsets speaks volumes. (Analyst estimates aren’t generous, suggesting \u003c500k units apiece.)\n\nSony did put out some sales figures for its Playstation VR headset in February which caused some initial excitement — with the company claiming 915,000 units sold since October 2016.\n\nBut by June that figure had merely drifted past 1M.\n\nMaybe summer just isn’t the season for VR.\n\nGoing to the beach to take selfies to put on Instagram \u003e virtual reality.\n\nComing down\n\nIn its 2017 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies report, analyst Gartner positions VR rising up its “slope of enlightenment” — which, visually speaking, looks over generous.\n\nAlthough really it just suggests VR has lost the power to disappoint quite so acutely — exactly because it’s already done so, having plunged from the lofty pinnacle of over-inflated expectations to smash into the grounding reality-check of slender consumer appetite for what the tech can actually deliver right now vs a still lofty price.\n\nThat gentle slope stretching in front of VR offers cold near-term comfort; it translates into looming years of long hard slog.\n\nEven if the lowest, most disappointing doldrums now lie behind VR, as Gartner reckons, talking to erstwhile VR enthusiasts, it’s clear that near-term enthusiasm for the tech is in short supply.\n\nGartner’s positioning gives VR a two- to five-year timeframe for achieving the hoped-for jackpot of mainstream adoption. The latter end of that guestimate seems more realistic to my eye.\n\nMeanwhile, the alternative notion that VR might actually be a niche — rather than mainstream — tech doesn’t seem too far-fetched at all.\n\nTime will tell.\n\nAnother VR cycle certainly feels dead in the water, if not completely sunk.\n\nOne bullish entrepreneur I spoke to recently on this topic conjured a future for VR in the centre of the living room, with TV screens replaced by pairs of VR glasses able to shutter between real and virtual views.\n\nHe said he could imagine himself and his girlfriend sitting side by side on the sofa watching a movie through their respective lenses.\n\nIt’s a thought — if a strange one.\n\nI mean, how would you exchange raised eyebrows and knowing glances with your S.O. if you’re both blinkered by a wearable? Such headsets would have to be very lightweight indeed — essentially a standard pair of glasses yet able to switch dynamically and intelligently between digital and real world views, say fading up your companion’s face when you turn toward them so you can try and catch their eye.\n\nFrankly, if the tech can’t be playful it just won’t be functional.\n\nBut of course, as it stands, VR hardware isn’t anywhere near engineering such slickly futuristic and socially acceptable feats.\n\nNor have we glimpsed, IRL, Magic Leap’s much hyped, years-in-the-making apparently-reality-bending goggles.\n\nBut even setting these most moonshot-y visions aside, the reality of current VR hardware and software isn’t even meeting rougher-and-readier early adopter expectations.\n\nAnd that’s a big failure.\n\nOnce again, hype has been allowed to lead — and first movers who shelled out to play in nascent virtual spaces are left feeling burnt or bummed. (As one TC colleague poetically put it: “VR headsets litter my office like the skulls of ancient enemies.”)\n\nAnother story: Last year I met a filmmaker and video producer who raved about VR as if he’d just had an out-of-body experience. He ranked himself 100% converted. He explained how, the evening before, he’d donned a headset in a room full of guys and stepped inside his first VR music video.\n\nWhen the video was done thumping its bass-beats into and around his body, he immediately reset the thing for a second go.\n\nHe was certain that VR was the next Big Thing. And said he planned to immediately start acquiring the skills and tools needed for his business to be able to offer VR content — to be ready for the expected tsunami of consumer demand.\n\nWhy was he so convinced about VR? He said it was because of the feeling of immersion. What about feeling immersed when you watch a film or go to the theatre to see a play?\n\nAn argument between convert and sceptic wound on for over an hour.\n\nSeveral days after this conversation, he sent me a tentative message of confession: “I went to the theatre the other day — I felt immersed.”\n\nNo essential content\n\nOne veteran games industry developer who works for a top tier games publisher — including advising on the platforms the company should support — and who previously took an early interest in Oculus and VR in general; excited to experiment and bullish on its prospects back then, now tells me flatly when I ask about the current status of VR: “Come back in five years.”\n\nHere’s what else he has to say:\n\nIt feels like the second-wave bubble of VR is about to burst.\n\nThe technology is incredibly exciting, and it has the potential to be huge one day. Unfortunately neither the hardware nor the software is ready for that yet. I was very excited when I first played with the Oculus DK2 — the technology was limited, but you could already see what the ambition was. The hardware has increased iteratively; but you need an incredible amount of horsepower and very well optimised low-latency engine to drive VR. Neither Unreal nor Unity are particularly well optimised… The big players who have the tech that could make a difference don’t see the demographics on VR yet, and the people won’t buy it without the killer apps. It’s like Nintendo made a cool new console with an innovative new hardware feature; but they sacked Miyamoto and their software department and forgot to make any games. VR is badly missing essential content. Oculus have failed to deliver here, despite putting Jason Rubin in charge and throwing around a bunch of money. Sony’s device is slicker, but underpowered and incapable of even delivering PS4 level graphics let alone surpassing them. The harsh truth is you really need $1,000 of kit to deliver modern AAA experiences in VR, and people don’t want to spend that, they don’t want to wear it, and they hate the cables and the clunkiness. We are not only seeing low hardware sales, but attach rates are terrible. Even owners of VR hardware are not buying software (at least not in the quantities needed to fund large games), and this is further limiting how it is growing.\n\nIt’s clear that VR needs the equivalent of a Nintendo ‘power brand’ — with existing beloved character caché — to be generously deployed as fuel to light up a network that simply isn’t there yet.\n\nIt’s the classic chicken and egg problem.\n\nJob Simulator may be a cute game for a few minutes of virtual soft play but it isn’t going to compel the vast masses to shell out and wire in.\n\nMeanwhile a hugely popular gaming franchise like Minecraft, which might on the surface seem a good theoretical fit for VR, has nonetheless been hampered by the tech’s nausea problem.\n\nTurns out roaming and spinning around inside a fully immersive 3D block-mining world can make you feelsick as a dog.\n\n(Incidentally, this does not surprise me in the least; I had to abandon Minecraft on a 2D screen after getting motion sickness from just a faux 3D-perspective. Full VR Minecraft? Frankly you couldn’t pay me to play that.)\n\nBut there’s another content-related problem too.\n\nWith an ongoing lack of “essential” — and perhaps we should add viably vomit-free — content, there’s a wider risk that VR is already being slow-branded a loser.\n\nSomething that, when you put on its geeky uniform, clings to you unpleasantly, like a queasiness you can’t shake — with an unmistakeable whiff of stale sweat and a vague and depressing feeling of failure.\n\nMuch like the carpets in early 2000s VHS video rental stores, the state of the VR ecosystem is already telling a story.\n\nMeanwhile VR’s few available virtual spaces are left to be largely appropriated by the marginal few — as playgrounds for their memes, their in-jokes and other seedier elements and even more unpleasant acts — further risking what VR is perceived as being. (And who it is perceived as being for.)\n\nVR risks becoming Second Life in immersive redux — after which it will only remain for articles to be penned telling the strange fable of ‘How an early dot-com 3D world predicted the fringe failure of modern VR.’\n\nEcosystem neglect being allowed to metastasize is a real risk for VR at the end of another cycle.\n\ni FUCKING HATE VR pic.twitter.com/uc0QLSmPj6 — drake (@Reactuh) August 3, 2017\n\nVR =/= AR\n\nRight now we can certainly confirm VR’s laundry-list of linked problems: Underpowered, expensive and awkward hardware that hasn’t sold well, saddling and saddled with a paucity of compelling content which isn’t engaging even its keenest early adopters.\n\nThe popular high point for VR so far has probably come via low budget mobile VR — aka, cheap and cheerful headsets such as the Samsung Gear VR or Google’s fold-it-yourself Cardboard which lets smartphone owners repurpose their mobile as a basic (so underpowered) virtual reality viewer by slotting it into a frame.\n\nBut even in mobile VR, sales of headsets aren’t exactly overwhelming. And the gizmo is clearly more gimmicky accessory than truly necessary.\n\nIt’s also hard to overlook the fact that mobile VR’s pinnacle moment of PR exposure managed to deliver the single most dystopian tech image of 2016 (IMO) — as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was photographed striding down a conference aisle wearing a rictus grin, while, alongside him, a roomful of men were apparently oblivious to his presence because they were all headsetted and wired in…\n\nThe stereotypically downturned slack mouth of the VR headset wearer, mobile or otherwise, most often appears as a gormless gape in photographs. This is in no small part because the headset baffles entirely that most subtle and sophisticated human communication tool: the eyes.\n\nIt seems possible that a mixed reality wearable, small enough and light enough to house the necessary tech within a standard pair of glasses — and which also manages not to obscure the wearer’s vision nor distort their facial appearance — could avoid such a problem.\n\nAlthough the awkward lesson of Google Glass (“Glassholes”) underlines that overtly geeky pairs of glasses will still be roundly rejected — however comfortable they might feel in self-selecting technobubble corners of Silicon Valley…\n\nInterestingly though, and at least for now, mobile AR has shown it can integrate successfully as a social technology without the need for any kind of headset or wearable — just utilizing the various apps that already exist for viewing and sharing augmented content on smartphones.\n\nWhether it’s a Snapchat selfie lense or style transfer applied to a Facebook live video or some other AI-powered face-altering photo processing app.\n\nPeople are very happy to play around with how they look in order to express how they feel — and also happy to do so because they don’t have to journey to some other, purely virtual space to do so. They can remain in control.\n\nMobile AR lets people change their spots and stripes, or see something novel and different without having to abandon their personal and social context entirely. Nor do they have to make themselves vulnerable in the process by giving up their peripheral vision. That’s very powerful.\n\nThis type of mobile augmented reality doesn’t force users to become or to feel anti-social. Its community of users retain their anchoring context, and can play within their existing social groups.\n\nIndeed, mobile AR is often inherently social. It encourages more and greater visual communication — just by giving people tools to create and share visuals that are part familiar, part fantastical.\n\nWhile they can appear to be some overlap with VR, it’s really not the same kettle of fish at all.\n\nAR is most often a social and expressive medium (though it can also be a utility); whereas VR’s big promise and pull is total escapism and the resulting ‘immersive’ entertainment value (with some potential use-cases for education/training) — though that of course means VR is having to compete for attention with existing entertainment powerhouse media, be it cinema, videogames or Netflix.\n\nIt should be clear by now that blending digital content with actual goings on in the real world opens up all sorts of functional and social opportunities that simply aren’t half so possible or accessible in VR — for all its powerful, clever underlying tech and graphical polish.\n\nYes there is the notion of ‘social VR’ — such as the below pictured Facebook Spaces, a still-in-beta concept platform for Oculus users to ‘socialize virtually’. Think of it as a sort of VR version of the 3D Playstation Home social gaming platform.\n\nBut no it’s not equivalent as you’re still required to ‘exist’ in a controlled elsewhere, beyond and/or outside your normal social spaces (where, it goes without saying, only, at best, a sub-set of your friends will also want to be).\n\nIn Facebook Spaces users are represented in an avatar form that, regardless of how much engineering attention is undoubtedly being paid to making hair swish and eyes crinkle, nonetheless come across as cartoonish and clunky vs, y’know, the actual human body with its rich and subtle physical language.\n\nAnd sure AR may never provide the kind of ‘out-of-body’ immersiveness that can generate such inaugural awe among first-time testers of VR. (Although Pokemon Go players may disagree.) But mixed reality as a technology is demonstrably more accessible and therefore more useful.\n\nAnd because it’s more social it follows that it has greater mass market potential.\n\nYou don’t have to look far to see mobile AR already demonstrably generating massive demand…\n\nBeyond Nintendo’s brand caché, and beyond app crazes like Snapchat lenses, you could even argue that groups of friends socializing in person and carrying on conversations while simultaneously holding and using their smartphones — to view and flip through content feeds and snap and share photos simultaneous to having real-life interactions — is a rudimentary form of mobile AR.\n\nBecause they’re blending their offline and online lives in quasi-real-time. (This is perhaps the best argument for, eventually, some kind of mobile AR wearable — i.e. to lift eyes back off screens and onto actual faces.)\n\nIt’s a modern social scene that’s being played out in physical social spaces all over the world right now. And it’s being achieved with just smartphone screens, camera lenses plus a bunch of social/messaging and sfx/image-augmenting apps. Additional dedicated hardware tools haven’t been necessary (yet).\n\nMeanwhile VR’s expensive weaponry lies gathering dust in early adopters’ homes, and the tech’s vested backers are facing years in the sloping wilderness. Enlightenment, if it comes, will be eventual.\n\nCome back in five years\n\nYes, this VR cycle is dead.\n\nThe VR industry has to hope this is only another cycle. And that another opportunity to build a viable ecosystem will come winging in again — in five or so years. Though as what?\n\nPerhaps a new cinema technology enabling fans to pay a premium to sit in a special type of movie theatre seat, pull down a visor and feel as if they’re occupying the body of their favorite actor in the movie. Heightened escapism for a few hedonistic minutes.\n\nIn-flight entertainment could present another bounded entertainment possibility. And there’s potential for education and training scenarios, and even rehabilitation and health use-cases, as we’ve already seen. And of course, there’s always VR porn.\n\nBut none of these segments and slivers suggests virtual reality is the next computing paradigm. (Even Facebook’s Zuckerberg now talks in terms of needing a decade before VR can realize its “full potential”.)\n\nOccasional training tool and/or the future of high end entertainment — just possibly. But, hey, no one likes to feel sick at the movies. Feeling like you want to barf is only a good use of your time and energy if you’ve eaten something that might otherwise kill you.\n\nThe wider question in the gaming space, which excels at entertainment and escapism, remains how big VR might get when the hardware isn’t so pricey and clunky, and when investing time and energy in building compelling content can start to look like less of a sinkhole prospect for developers who can now be seen pulling their horns in.\n\nThese same types of content makers may well be having their heads turned by the potential of AR gaming. Which can, as noted above, already point to the existence of essential content generating wild excitement among millions of consumers.\n\nRather like the solar eclipse, AR has been shown turning masses of heads and even gathering huge crowds of like-minded folks together in public.\n\nFor now there is simply no argument: AR \u003e VR.\n\nAnd increasing momentum behind AR also risks being another depression point for VR.\n\nEarlier this week Jason Toff, Google VR’s creativity product lead, tweeted out what might be construed as a throwaway Twitter poll — asking which industry will have a bigger market capitalization in five years’ time: VR/AR or cannabis (which has been legalized for recreational use in some US states).\n\nThe poll concluded with cannabis winning the vote, 70: 30\n\nWhich industry will be bigger (market cap) in 5 years? — Jason Toff (@jasontoff) August 21, 2017\n\nThe poll’s bundling of VR with AR wasn’t really fair — and you can argue VR’s performance here is probably being artificially inflated by AR’s rising store. Because even if the AR/VR line is being blurred, these technologies have not converged — if indeed they ever successfully can.\n\nOnly one is trying to sell users on an entirely escapist virtual reality. So, in some senses, bundling VR with weed might have been a more accurate pairing for Toff to offer.\n\n(For the record, in our TC Convo thread on this topic, there was general agreement that AR\u003eWeed\u003eVR .)\n\nLast word\n\nAs a human, it’s fair to say there are many ways to induce and experience an altered state or mood, or otherwise engineer a shift in your perspective — whether your tool of choice is smoking weed, reading a great book, drinking with friends or, indeed, pulling on a VR headset and being transported to the surface of a strange and alien world.\n\nSo far, though, virtual reality has to take the inglorious award for being among the least popular of humanity’s myriad entertainment tools — with no prospect of any change on the horizon.\n\nAs it happens, another total solar eclipse is due to pass over the US in a little over five years’ time — in April 2024. It’s funny to think that the people donning protective goggles and looking up at the sky then probably still won’t know for sure if VR will ever be able to eclipse its disappointing shadow.\n\nHattip to TechCrunch’s Romain Dillet for the headline, and Bryce Durbin for the original artwork","author":"Natasha Lomas","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T16:00:44.000Z"},"source":"techcrunch","urlToImage":"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/eclipse-skull-80.jpg","digest":"BBZFXGcErth1TyZlpO26/Q==\n"}

That's the idea behind many of Amazon's businesses, and that's..","title":"Amazon will lose money on Whole Foods — but probably not for long","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/amazon-will-lose-money-on-whole-foods-but-probably-not-for-long/","text":"Sometimes giving up something in the short-term can yield a big reward in the long-term. That’s the idea behind many of Amazon’s businesses, and that’s particularly true of the recent Whole Foods deal.\n\nAmazon’s purchase of the upscale Whole Foods grocery chain for $13.7 billion will go through on Monday, and already the online retailer has said prices will drop on certain organic staples starting then.\n\nThe news sent other grocery retailer stock prices tumbling. Walmart fell by 5 percent, Costco was down by 7 percent and Kroger plummeted a whopping 9 percent. Altogether, the three lost nearly $19 billion in market value the June day that Amazon announced the deal.\n\nLike most other Amazon business services, the Everything Store stands to lose a good deal of money on the grocery chain. “This is going to be a money pit for them,” says Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures and a former Amazon analyst at Piper Jaffray.\n\nSo why the acquisition? Because food sales haven’t really shifted online, and Amazon aims to change that. Sure, there are apps for meal delivery services. There’s also Instacart and even Amazon’s grocery delivery Amazon Fresh. But Munster argues the Whole Foods deal changes the game. “This is global domination theory,” he says. “That may take five years, but as the order density starts to increase it can scale.”\n\nIn other words, it doesn’t matter right now that Amazon is losing potential billions. For the first time, it will have a physical location in every well-heeled ZIP code in America. Combine that with its ability to run logistics at scale, and Amazon is betting that it will crush the competition and increase sales to a point where it starts turning a much larger profit later on.\n\nYou can bet that other grocers are taking a much harder look at their delivery and online purchase options as a result. Walmart has already introduced plans for a drone-deploying blimp to deliver items in specific locations and a drive-up option at its warehouses to make purchasing easier. (Amazon, you may recall, filed a patent for a similar drone-filled floating warehouse a year ago for the same purpose.) Many regional and local chains are also looking to speed deliveries by expanding their online services, including Albertson’s.\n\nNot everyone is excited about the moves, unsurprisingly. President Trump has called Amazon a monopoly. A union representing grocery workers has also warned that the deal is a “threat to Whole Foods workers and their families,” and suggested these employees demand a commitment from Amazon that it not automate their jobs.\n\nThere’s seemingly little to stop it now, however. The Federal Trade Commission has blessed the deal, saying that following an investigation into the tie-up, it doesn’t think it will substantially lessen competition.\n\nThat’s a good thing, too, as far as Munster is concerned. He sees lower prices, more selection, better experience and quicker delivery on everything you can imagine a pretty great proposition for customers — especially because it’s one retailer who is providing all of it, not in spite of the fact.\n\n“The beautiful thing about Amazon is that you have infinite choice,” Munster says. “The selection is 300 million-plus [products]. As long as the consumer experience is good, and choice is good, that’s what’s most important.”","author":"Sarah Buhr","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T00:36:38.000Z"},"source":"techcrunch","urlToImage":"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/amazon-whole-foods-banner.jpg","digest":"NrKMsJPkoBUF3M4SUVSmYA==\n"}

Just yesterday, Uber offered $125,000 to Black Girls Code, but the organization turned it down, Black Girls Code founder Kimberly Bryant told TechCrunch.\n\n“My decision is layered,” Bryant told TechCrunch. “I’ve been quite open for some time about the fact that we as an org use Uber as a tool. We’re also headquartered in the city [Oakland] where they have planned to move. So I’ve been open to the notion that they can transform themselves. Yet their past history and ‘political’ nature of maneuvering is and was troubling.”\n\nBryant went on to say that Uber has given very little money to Oakland and that it’s a bit disingenuous to see such a large grant go to Girls Who Code. She added, it “seems a bit tone-deaf to really addressing real change in how they are moving towards both inclusion and equity. It appears to be more PR driven than actually focused on real change. So we turned it down.”\n\nJust yesterday, Uber announced it was giving $1.2 million in grant money to Girls Who Code, a nonprofit organization focused on closing the gender gap in tech by teaching girls how to code. But some people aren’t happy with Uber’s first grantee, saying that in light of everything that has happened around sexual harassment at the company, Uber should have invested in a women in tech organization or an organization that supports victims of sexual harassment.\n\nAfter Fowler’s allegations surfaced, Uber conducted a workplace harassment investigation, released a diversity report and said it would commit $3 million over the next three years to support organizations focused on diversity in tech.\n\nFowler was among some of the people speaking out against Uber’s grant to Girls Who Code, saying that if Uber wants to improve its image, it should help the women Uber has hurt.\n\nHey Uber, how about you give financial restitution to the employees that were harassed, discriminated, and retaliated out of their jobs? https://t.co/EzYFhkusNp — Susan J. Fowler (@susanthesquark) August 24, 2017\n\nUber donated to *Girls* Who Code\n\nNot Women Who Code\n\nNot a sexual harassment victims group\n\nNot their own victims It's the same story as ever https://t.co/5mOCXUxMk6 — Alice Goldfuss (@alicegoldfuss) August 25, 2017\n\nI'm reminded of @me_gardiner's \"I take it we aren’t cute enough for you?\" from 5 years ago: https://t.co/beWoBoEAY4 https://t.co/LOtsI0wVGx — Leigh Honeywell (@hypatiadotca) August 25, 2017\n\nThose points are all fair. Though, as I mentioned, this is Uber’s first investment and there’s still $1.5 million left to put into diversity in tech organizations. It’s worth noting that when I initially spoke to Uber, the company said the investment to Girls Who Code would probably be the largest commitment to a single organization.\n\nI’ve reached out to Uber and will update this story if I hear back.","author":"Megan Rose Dickey","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-25T19:20:17.000Z"},"source":"techcrunch","urlToImage":"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/black-girls-code-kimberly-bryant.jpg","digest":"Aijj5xvaRHTnEPp/t7fvQg==\n"}

After Mr. Trump left, Mr. Cohn stood uncomfortably fielding questions about the president’s statements, and he repeatedly declined to comment.\n\nHe debated for over a week with his wife and friends on whether to quit, according to the people familiar with his thinking. This week, Mr. Cohn decided to remain in his job, believing he could be more effective as a public servant inside the White House than out of it.\n\nHe is one of the few Jewish members in the administration who have publicly condemned Mr. Trump’s remarks about Charlottesville, although he has quietly disagreed with the president on a number of policy matters.\n\nAs Mr. Trump stood by his equivocal comments on Charlottesville and business leaders left presidential advisory panels in protest, Mr. Cohn told The Financial Times, he felt “enormous pressure” to step down. Various friends, and Mr. Cohn’s wife, were at one point among those who were urging him to resign, said several people familiar with their advice.\n\nA senior administration official said the president was not surprised by Mr. Cohn’s remarks to The Financial Times. Another official said the sentiments had been relayed clearly to Mr. Trump, and Mr. Cohn had said that if asked, he would say how he felt.\n\nBut on Friday, Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, tweeted that Mr. Cohn “should be fired immediately for his public attack on the president.” In his tweet, Mr. Stone misspelled the name of Mr. Cohn, whom he has aggressively criticized, and said the economic adviser was “recommended for his White House job by Jared Kushner.”\n\nIt is highly unusual for a senior member of any presidential administration to publicly discuss the possibility of stepping down. Geoff Garin, a veteran Democratic pollster who worked on Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, said even though Mr. Cohn did not criticize Mr. Trump by name in the Financial Times interview, “the comments are still very tough and very blunt, including his comments about the push-and-pull whether to stay and whether to go.”\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

For Mr. Cohn, said two people familiar with his thinking, every day at the White House requires a different calculus over how best to spend his political capital. Right now, these people said, he will focus on economic policies that he believes are essential to the stability of the markets and the United States work force — even when other issues worry him.\n\nNudging Mr. Trump toward a more free-trade stance that avoids harsh steps toward China and other economic partners is paramount, these people said. Part of that, they added, is opposing tariffs on steel, aluminum and other goods that might damage relationships with American allies.\n\nBut using political capital on those fights means avoiding others, even when the president espouses policies that run contrary to Mr. Cohn’s own principles, the two people said. Among other things, they said, Mr. Cohn disagrees with the president’s directive banning transgender people from joining the military, but will leave that fight to others.\n\nOn Aug. 17, with word of Mr. Cohn’s unhappiness percolating on Wall Street, some traders and investors got jittery. Seeing Mr. Cohn as a key player in pushing forward the Trump administration’s tax cuts, some sold American stocks, pushing prices down.\n\nMr. Cohn, a onetime silver trader who eventually became president of Goldman Sachs, was struck by the market move, said two people familiar with his thinking. He continued to huddle with friends and family over what steps to take, attending meetings in Washington during the process.\n\nAt some point during the past 10 days, Mr. Cohn penned a tentative resignation letter, said the three people familiar with the draft. It was not immediately clear what day the letter was written, or if Mr. Trump was ever made aware of it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut during a private Aug. 18 meeting with the president at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., Mr. Cohn relayed his concerns about Mr. Trump’s comments on Charlottesville, said people with knowledge of the gathering. The exact details of the talk are not clear, but the president urged Mr. Cohn to stay.\n\n“I have had numerous private conversations with the president on this topic,” Mr. Cohn told The Financial Times, adding that “I have not been bashful saying what I think.”\n\nOne possible part of Mr. Cohn’s calculus is the chance that he could be named Federal Reserve chairman early next year, a move Mr. Trump has said he is considering. Mr. Cohn has in the past expressed interest in the job, said two people close to him. But unlike past Fed chairmen, Mr. Cohn is not an economist, and some of his friends have said it is hard to imagine him in the more reserved, less dynamic environment of the Fed, which would be a huge contrast to the pace of Goldman Sachs or the White House.\n\nSteven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, who also is Jewish, defended Mr. Trump in a statement a week ago, after more than 300 of his Yale classmates urged him in a letter to step down. At a briefing with reporters at the White House on Friday, Mr. Mnuchin, an old business partner of Mr. Trump who has at times clashed over policy with Mr. Cohn, told reporters that under no circumstances has he considered resigning.","author":"Kate Kelly and Maggie Haberman","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T19:11:50.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/25/us/25cohn-alphaSub/25cohn-alphaSub-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"Z1baZFOURlseB0pJPzCqcg==\n"}

Others, not so much.\n\nOne unresolved question, Mr. Schwartz writes, is whether climate change is affecting the number and the intensity of the storms. It could be making some stronger, and certainly wetter. In the article, Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech and one of the authors of a sweeping climate science report, notes that scientists are not saying that hurricanes are necessarily caused by climate change, but are being affected by them.\n\n“We care about a changing climate because it exacerbates the natural risks and hazards that we already face,” she said. “People always want to know is it climate change or is it not?

While oil prices have not soared even as many offshore production platforms have been shut, gasoline futures in New York have risen to their highest levels of the summer driving season. So far, though, prices at the pump around the Gulf region remain at historically low levels for this time of year, and more than a dime below the national average of $2.35.\n\nDrivers in the Houston area waited in lines at the pump Thursday night, preparing for several days of shortages.\n\nNearly a third of the nation’s refinery capacity is along the Gulf. The port of Corpus Christi, the main port for oil and gasoline exports, has been closed. Conoco Phillips and several other companies have suspended drilling operations to the south and west of Corpus Christi. — CLIFFORD KRAUSS in Houston\n\nShelters open for evacuees in Texas cities.\n\nOfficials in San Antonio have been working for days to prepare for evacuees from the coastal region, as well as local residents who may be forced to leave their homes if flooding occurs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTwo shelters have been set up and more will be added as needed, said Marty McKellips, chief executive of the Central and South Texas Region of the American Red Cross. Governor Abbott said at his news conference that more than 50 shelters had been set up around the state.\n\n“So far, we’ve received almost 700 total evacuees, with 10 additional full buses waiting to check in as we speak,” Mayor Ron Nirenberg said. “We expect that number to climb as coastal cities continue to experience significant rainfall and high winds.”\n\nHundreds of relief workers have come from around the state to help man the shelters, and medical facilities in San Antonio have already received many patients from coastal areas, the Bexar county judge, Nelson Wolff, said.\n\n“Some 190 patients have been moved up to the Bexar County area to be able to be transferred to a safer hospital environment,” Mr. Wolff said. — STACI SEMRAD in San Antonio\n\nIt’s not just the wind, it’s the water.\n\nForecasters are saying this is the first major hurricane to hit the United States in 12 years. That’s the kind of statement that is accurate, but galling for those who went through storms like Sandy in the Northeast in 2012, or Ike, which was so destructive to the Texas Gulf Coast in 2008.\n\nThe distinction is this: to be called a major storm, a hurricane must be Category 3 or higher on the Saffer-Simpson hurricane wind scale, which means winds of 111 to 129 miles an hour. Those winds can bring “devastating” damage, stripping off roof decking and bringing down many trees. Ike was a Category 2, though it pushed a monster storm surge. Sandy had become what is known as a post-tropical storm before it made landfall. Late Friday, Hurricane Harvey became a Category 4 storm with sustained winds of 130 miles per hour.\n\nThe lesson is that it is not just wind that makes a storm dangerous. Storm surge, the water that a hurricane pushes ahead of it, can be tremendously destructive. Much more harm was done to New Orleans during Katrina because of the surge — which overwhelmed the area’s faulty levees — than the wind.\n\nBeyond surge is the rainwater. Tropical Storm Allison was not even at hurricane strength when it came to Houston in 2001, but it sat over the city in much the way that Harvey is expected to do. Southeast Texas suffered nearly $5 billion in damage from the storm, with 22 deaths. — JOHN SCHWARTZ\n\nMexican authorities issue safety warnings.\n\nMexico, through its National Weather System, issued a statement on Friday morning forecasting “intense storms” in the northern states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and Coahuila near the Gulf. The Mexican authorities strongly recommended that people in the region take safety precautions ahead of heavy rain, wind and waves. — PAULINA VILLEGAS in Mexico City","author":"The New York Times","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T10:14:43.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/26/us/26live-storm-promo/26live-storm-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"QDyZwMPBGEnNjx1PwSzuKg==\n"}

Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, accused Mr. Trump of “using the cover of the storm” to pardon Mr. Arpaio and to issue a formal ban on transgender people from joining the military. (The ban also gives the secretary of defense wide latitude to decide whether currently serving transgender troops should remain in the military.)\n\n“The only reason to do these right now is to use the cover of Hurricane Harvey to avoid scrutiny,” Mr. Schumer said in a series of tweets late Friday. “So sad, so weak.”\n\nMr. Trump’s supporters hailed the pardon as a sign the president was keeping his word on his campaign pledge to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKelli Ward, a former Arizona state senator who is challenging Senator Jeff Flake in a Republican primary for his seat in 2018, called Mr. Arpaio “a patriot who did the job the Feds refused to do.” Mr. Trump has endorsed Ms. Ward’s candidacy.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator John McCain, also an Arizona Republican, denounced the pardon of Mr. Arpaio.\n\n“No one is above the law,” he said, “and the individuals entrusted with the privilege of being sworn law officers should always seek to be beyond reproach in their commitment to fairly enforcing the laws they swore to uphold.”\n\nThe discussion about pardoning Mr. Arpaio had begun weeks ago, while Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, was still in the administration, according to two people briefed on the matter.\n\nBut the decision to make the announcement during a national news blackout related to the impending hurricane was not accidental. Some in the Trump administration had cautioned against it as too controversial, and had urged waiting, if it were going to be done.\n\nMr. Bannon had favored the move, as had Mr. Trump’s policy adviser, Stephen Miller, a former adviser to Jeff Sessions, the attorney general and a former senator for whom Mr. Miller served as press secretary.\n\nMr. Sessions and Mr. Miller share a hard-line view on curtailing immigration levels, and Mr. Arpaio had become a national avatar for Mr. Trump, who had a good relationship with the sheriff during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump had once told Mr. Arpaio that he would try to help him if he could down the road.\n\nBut that was before Mr. Trump was closing in on Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. Still, he was fond of Mr. Arpaio, and was sold on the pardon as a way of pleasing his political base. Additionally, Mr. Miller fought hard for the pardon, according to a senior administration official.","author":"Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Maggie Haberman","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T18:02:33.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/26/us/00dc-arpaio-hfo/00dc-arpaio-hfo-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"PR4l9EQT3hEeZlOZqcA04w==\n"}

The song sets a mood for her sixth album, due in November.","title":"Taylor Swift Goes to a Darker Place: Discuss","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/arts/music/taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do.html","text":"To discuss the song and where it positions Ms. Swift after a bumpy few years for her public persona, we’ve gathered the critics Jon Caramanica, Jon Pareles and Wesley Morris, as well as the pop music editor Caryn Ganz. Another day, another drama.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJON PARELES Sure, Taylor Swift has deleted her social media trail and declared “the old Taylor” dead. But her most treasured persona — Taylor the avenger — remains alive and more unforgiving than ever on “Look What You Made Me Do.”\n\nMs. Swift’s songs have been settling scores — and showing her fans that wronged women can speak up — ever since her music had country trappings and her (ex-)boyfriends weren’t necessarily famous. But this is one is pure accusation, as if it’s more about a transaction than a relationship.\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether “Look What You Made Me Do” can be parsed as the latest go-round in Ms. Swift’s tabloid-fodder celebrity feuds or as more general post-breakup venting: “I don’t like your perfect crime/How you laugh when you lie.” The important thing is that she has the upper hand again.\n\nAs a pop song, it’s inside-out. Its verses and choruses are as ruthlessly stark as a hip-hop production, mostly just drumbeats and electronic tones, behind a nursery-rhyme melody in the verse and a rhythmic chant in the chorus.\n\nThere’s a plusher, more dramatic arrangement, with piano and brass-like synthesizers, in the prechorus, while the bridge is orchestrated with strings: “I don’t trust nobody and nobody trusts me.” Those sections are archly melodramatic, “emotional” with air quotes.\n\nBut the chorus itself, instead of unfurling a grand melody line, just chants the song title: eight times with slight variations, in tones that can be vindictive, mocking, dismissive, even a little playful. (The video image is ouroboros, the snake swallowing its own tail, the celebrity news cycle on endless repeat.) She’s not trying to sound pretty, or to provide the big group singalong release of a big chorus hook; she’s counterpunching. The title of the album due in November is “Reputation”; let’s hope it’s not all about this.\n\nStill, this song arrives only days after Ms. Swift won a sexual-assault case involving a radio host who groped her during a meet-and-greet photo session. It was a countersuit, asking for symbolic damages of $1, that she initiated after he sued her alleging her accusation was false. Look what he made her do.\n\nJON CARAMANICA “I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative”: Ms. Swift wrote those words just 13 months ago, but as has become clear in this country, 13 months is a lifetime.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nHer new single is ongoing litigation — a broadside against Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, a retort to their campaign against her in the wake of the fallout following the release of Mr. West’s “Famous,” which Mr. West took as a joke and Ms. Swift took as a slight.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis new song is both a rejection and embrace of the narrative that caricatured her as a manipulator passing for a naïf. Rather than ignoring that circumstance, and its attendant public conversation, altogether, “Look What You Made Me Do” extends the drama in an effort to seize control of it.\n\nAs warfare, it is casual verging on blithe. Ms. Swift has always had enemies — antagonists animate her — but this is not as savage as “Dear John,” or even “Mean,” songs written for a specific target.\n\nThat is because the true subject of this song is not any particular opponent; it is herself. Near the end, she announces that the old Taylor is dead — that’s true in several ways, most notably in the way she leans in to the drama she once tried to dodge: “I don’t like your tilted stage,” she hisses at Mr. West. (There are other indications that Mr. West remains near the front of Ms. Swift’s mind: some of her new merchandise uses a font that’s similar to the one Mr. West popularized on his “The Life of Pablo” T-shirts. One hopes it is a coincidence that her scheduled album release date falls on the 10th anniversary of the death of Mr. West’s mother, Donda.)\n\nBut also Ms. Swift as a classic formalist songwriter, that’s dead too. “Look What You Made Me Do” is an attitude, a pose, an energy — it sounds like the introduction to something more acidic yet to come. This song is half-rapped, or half-spoken, a calculated jolt away from the sparkling melodies she’s always excelled at, even at her unhappiest. The production — by Jack Antonoff and Ms. Swift — is slippery and caustic, reminiscent of the places electro and industrial overlapped with pop in the mid-1980s. There’s barely any guitar to speak of, and at the chorus, rather than belt or soar, she bobs and weaves, repeating the title phrase like a nonchalant taunt. The credits suggest an interpolation of Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy,” but the tone and texture say early Kesha, or Fergie.\n\nThe whole thing is strikingly measured. It is her biggest shift in tone since the one-two punch of “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” and “I Knew You Were Trouble,” in 2012. But those songs were boisterous and savvy iterations of ideas she’d already been exploring. “Look What You Made Me Do,” by contrast, is a gut renovation, and shows that Ms. Swift is willing to incinerate herself if that’s what it takes to burn everyone else.\n\nWESLEY MORRIS Gang, we are gathered here today to celebrate this thing called strife. And I’m bummed. There’s no room, in this rendition of strife, for the usual shading and wit and flexible scale of Ms. Swift’s songwriting. She’s so good at petulance, spite, comeuppance and denouncement. She’s even better at a kind of pop song that’s harder to pull off, but that the greats, from Aretha Franklin to Fiona Apple, achieve with sneaky ease, which is mutual recrimination: We’re both fools! That emotional dexterity is on a break.\n\nVengeance might be on Ms. Swift’s mind right now, and not because she loves herself some Carly Simon (well, not only that). She just won a sexual assault case that she’s held up as victory for all women, on the one hand. She’s been in an unflatteringly comical fight with Ms. Perry, on the other. “Vengeance” sounds petty and vindictive here. As it is, that title is more or less what Kathy Bates screams at James Caan not that long into “Misery.” But it’s also music (and titling) that seems defensive, wittingly or not, at pop music as much as any one pop star. This song doesn’t sound felt. It sounds compelled to matter. It sounds cynical.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Taylor declares herself — the old her — dead via phone call, in the breakdown, it gave me the “13 Reasons Why” blues. (Good luck with that, America’s middle-school administrators!) I much prefer the violence in a song like “I Knew You Were Trouble,” where she’s melodically evocative about the physical state of being hurt.\n\n“Flew me to places I’d never been\n\n’Til you put me down, oh\n\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\n\nSo shame on me now\n\nFlew me to places I’d never been\n\nNow I’m lying on the cold hard ground”\n\nAlso: What a fun song to sing. Even in the pain, there’s a kind of ecstasy. I’ve listened to “Look What You Made Me Do” five times now, and I don’t hear that. I hear Ms. Perry, Peaches, Lorde, Fergie, J.J. Fad, and, lord help me, J.J. Fad courtesy of Fergie. What I can’t hear is Taylor Swift. Just about all her peers can speak electropop fluently. She’s doing remedial exercises on this one, and all I hear is her cramming.\n\nCARYN GANZ It’s fury, it’s vengeance, it’s gossip. It’s a horror movie, a fairy tale contorted into a calamity. Musically, it’s a pubescent growth spurt — sudden, jerky and accompanied by a sneer.\n\n“Look What You Made Me Do” feels like pure calculation: This one isn’t for the moms toe-tapping at the “1989” concert, or the radio stations still chin-scratching over whether Ms. Swift is country or pop. This song is for the base — the superfans on the internet who are always ready for a fight.\n\nThe music? It can be fascinating, alternately cinematic and grindy. The lyric video? It’s stark and striking. Taken together, they feel almost like a Twenty One Pilots project, shape-shifting and dark. But then there’s that “you” looming over everything.\n\nThe song isn’t called “Look What I Did,” it’s “Look What You Made Me Do,” a surprising flipping of agency at a moment where Ms. Swift is being heralded for her strong language in court, where she testified that a radio host assaulted her with no equivocation: “I’m being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are a product of his decisions. Not mine.” But making this song was her decision: not his. It sounds powerful, yet joyless.\n\nAnd while the track may be about her longtime antagonist Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry is once again collateral damage here: Her album “Witness” came out the same day Ms. Swift restored her catalog to Spotify, and she’ll be hosting the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday night — where Ms. Swift is unveiling her full new video, ensuring the name on everybody’s lips is gonna be Taylor.","author":"Joe Coscarelli, Jon Pareles, Jon Caramanica, Wesley Morris and Caryn Ganz","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T09:47:11.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/26/insider/26taylor1/26taylor1-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"WBC9/HSqZun/8T49p+oUKA==\n"}

The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment dictates that neither life nor liberty nor property may be deprived absent “due process,” which the Supreme Court construes to require adjudication by a neutral judge.\n\nIn short, under the Constitution one cannot be deprived of liberty without a court ruling upon the legality of the detention. The power of courts to restrain government officers from depriving citizens of liberty absent judicial process is the only meaningful way courts have to enforce important constitutional protections. But if the president can employ the pardon power to circumvent constitutional protections of liberty, there is very little left of the constitutional checks on presidential power.\n\nI am not suggesting that the pardon power itself provides for a due process exception. To the contrary, on its face the pardon power appears virtually unlimited. But as a principle of constitutional law, anything in the body of the Constitution inconsistent with the directive of an amendment is necessarily pre-empted or modified by that amendment. If a particular exercise of the pardon power leads to a violation of the due process clause, the pardon power must be construed to prevent such a violation.\n\nI admit that this is a novel theory. There’s no Supreme Court decision, at least that I know of, that deals specifically with the extent to which the president may employ his pardon power in this way.\n\nBut if the president can immunize his agents in this manner, the courts will effectively lose any meaningful authority to protect constitutional rights against invasion by the executive branch. This is surely not the result contemplated by those who drafted and ratified the Fifth Amendment, and surely not the result dictated by precepts of constitutional democracy. All that would remain to the courts by way of enforcement would be the possibility of civil damage awards, hardly an effective means of stopping or deterring invasions of the right to liberty.\n\nAnyone who has read the Federalist Papers knows how obsessed the framers were with the need to prevent tyranny. They were all too aware of the sad fate of all the republics that had preceded ours — rapid degeneration into tyranny. One of the most effective means of preventing tyranny was the vesting of the power of judicial review in a court system insulated from direct political pressures. Subsequent enactment of the Bill of Rights, which included the Fifth Amendment and its due process clause, only strengthened the nation’s resolve to prevent tyranny.\n\nIt has long been recognized that the greatest threat of tyranny derives from the executive branch, where the commander in chief sits, overseeing not just the military but a vast and growing network of law enforcement and regulatory agencies. Indeed, the Articles of Confederation didn’t even provide for an executive, for fear of what dangerous power he might exercise.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile the Constitution, in contrast, recognizes the very practical need for an executive, that doesn’t mean its framers feared the growth of tyranny any less. The Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of neutral judicial process before deprivation of liberty cannot function with a weaponized pardon power that enables President Trump, or any president, to circumvent judicial protections of constitutional rights.","author":"Martin H.

Chad Batka for The New York Times\n\nAll my life I’ve loved Texas: those big skies, big steaks and big attitudes. I’m there several times a year.\n\nBut Texas doesn’t love me back. Certainly its lawmakers don’t, and lately they’ve been hellbent on showing that.\n\nIn June the governor signed a bill allowing child welfare groups to refuse adoptions that contradict their “sincerely held religious beliefs.” They can turn away gay men like me.\n\nThat same month, the Texas Supreme Court approved a lawsuit challenging the city of Houston’s provision of equal benefits to all married employees, including those with same-sex spouses. Although the United States Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015, Texas bucks and balks.\n\nNot New York. My state loves me something fierce. What it did in June was finalize the design of a monument to L.G.B.T. citizens in downtown Manhattan. New York legalized same-sex marriage back in 2011 without any federal nudge.\n\nThere’s no such thing as L.G.B.T. life in America, a country even more divided on this front than on others. There’s L.G.B.T. life in a group of essentially progressive places like New York, Maryland, Oregon and California, which bans government-funded travel to states it deems unduly discriminatory. Then there is L.G.B.T. life on that blacklist, which includes Texas, Kansas, Mississippi and South Dakota.\n\nThe differences between states — and between cities within states — are profound, and while that has long been true, it’s much more consequential since the advent of the Trump administration, a decidedly less ready ally of L.G.B.T. people than the Obama administration was.\n\nThe federal government under Donald Trump won’t be rushing in to help L.G.B.T. people whose local governments fail to give them equal rights, a sense of belonging or even a feeling of physical safety. Despite Trump’s happy campaign talk about how fond he was of gays (and, Trump being Trump, how fond they were of him), his record as president has been hurtful and hateful. Immediately after his inauguration, references to the L.G.B.T. community were scrubbed from many federal websites, including the White House’s and the Department of State’s.\n\nPlenty of the people he pulled into his cabinet have long histories of pronounced opposition to gay rights. One of them, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, leads a Department of Justice that recently went out of its way to make clear, in court filings, that it did not consider L.G.B.T. people to be protected by a federal civil rights law that prohibits employment discrimination.

His first Supreme Court appointment suggests that if he is able to ensconce several more, the same-sex-marriage ruling could well be revisited and changed.\n\nBut worry not! Ivanka Trump has our backs! She has tweeted as much, and I guess we’re supposed to find consolation in those crumbs.\n\nWe’re at the mercy of our ZIP codes: Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are often affected most by their municipality, not their state. In Waco, Tex., the lone justice of the peace who presides over weddings recently admitted that she won’t do so for same-sex couples no matter the federal law. But Houston, just a three-hour drive away, has in instances been a pioneer: Annise Parker, its mayor from 2010 to 2016, is the only openly L.G.B.T. person ever elected to lead one of the nation’s 10 most populous cities. And Austin, the state’s capital, is practically Key West, Fla. — minus the coconuts.\n\nTyler, Tex. “I came out at 60 ... and I was told I could no longer hold any positions of leadership in my church.” I am—or was—Southern Baptist. After I was invited to share my coming-out story in the public library, patrons complained and the talk was canceled. I stay here because my children are near. Lou Anne Smoot 78, lesbian, retired teacher Austin, Tex. “Austin is a little protected bubble: a blue bubble in a red state.” There’s a gay pride parade. There’s a gay pride week. I never had to worry about letting bosses know that I was gay. I’ve been with my current partner for about 11 years. We can kiss on the street corner or in our front yard. Charles Castle 71, gay, retired school librarian\n\nOur cities and our states often dictate how easily we can be our true selves at work, buy wedding cakes, construct families — even die. I asked Jon Davidson of Lambda Legal, an L.G.B.T. advocacy group, about current cases that illustrate just how repressive some corners of America remain. He told me about Picayune, Miss., where an 86-year-old gay man passed away last year, leaving behind his 82-year-old husband. They had been together for half a century.\n\nAlthough prior arrangements had been made with a local funeral home, it refused even to pick up the dead man’s body when it learned of his same-sex marriage, according to a breach-of-contract lawsuit by his husband that hasn’t yet been resolved.\n\nI told Davidson that I thought that such don’t-make-me-touch-it hysteria ended 25 years ago.\n\n“Many parts of the country are 25 years ago,” he responded, drawing special attention to the southeastern quarter, from Texas to South Carolina, which, he said, may well generate more than half of the lawsuits that Lambda becomes involved in.\n\nSouth Carolina: another state that I love, another state that doesn’t love me back, and the home of Tommy Starling, 45, and his husband, Jeff Littlefield, 61. Starling told me that they live there, in the coastal community of Pawleys Island, because of Littlefield’s job in the insurance business, but they dream constantly of moving somewhere that doesn’t cast them as provocative social experiments, somewhere that doesn’t put and keep them on edge.\n\nThey had trouble trying to adopt in South Carolina, so they turned to California and to surrogacy to have their 11-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son. Starling said that his family stands out in Pawleys Island in a way that it wouldn’t in Brooklyn — or, for that matter, Atlanta — and disparaging, even menacing, remarks have come his way. To protect his kids from such ugliness, he has created, and works to preserve, a bubble of open-minded people around them.\n\n“But it’s getting exhausting,” he said, adding that the family’s occasional travel sustains him. He recalled a trip not long ago to San Francisco, where his husband reached out to hold his hand in public and he reflexively tensed.\n\n“He had to remind me that it was O.K. there,” Starling told me.\n\n“My fiancé and I get disgusted looks when we hold hands walking into places.”\n\nHolding hands. Such a small thing — and yet so incredibly big for many gay couples in conservative environments and even for some couples in more liberal areas that can nonetheless seem threatening. That came through poignantly in more than 1,000 responses that The Times received after asking L.G.B.T. readers to share their reflections on the freedoms and limitations of where they live.\n\nLaramie, Wyo. “Wyoming doesn’t have any state laws that protect us from discrimination or hate.” They recently tried to pass a bill letting business owners, on religious grounds, deny service to L.G.B.T. people. It makes me feel very unwelcome. I feel powerless. I feel attacked almost. Josiah Masie 22, gay, in Laramie, near where Matthew Shepard was fatally beaten in a gay-related hate crime in 1998 Seattle “I definitely feel as though I can be 100 percent open here.” The comfort is so alien compared to Montana or Wyoming. There hasn’t been a single day that I haven’t seen some variety of pride flag on someone’s car, on their home or in storefront windows. I feel grateful. Keleigh Russell 23, lesbian, grew up in Wyoming, went to college in Montana\n\nReaders were acutely conscious of the absence or presence of employment-related anti-discrimination laws in their cities or states. (Only 22 states have such laws governing all gay and lesbian workers, in both the public and the private sectors, while only 20, including New York, have them for transgender workers as well.) Readers mentioned the vigor, or laxness, with which their local governments patrolled against and prosecuted hate crimes.\n\nAnd one after another, readers said they wished that a modest public gesture of affection wasn’t a potent magnet for stares, slurs or worse.\n\nFrom a 45-year-old lesbian in Laingsburg, Mich.: “Sometimes I fantasize about living in parts of N.Y.C. or Provincetown, where I would be able to feel comfortable walking down the street holding hands with my wife, but our roots are here.” From a 34-year-old lesbian in Lubbock, Tex.: “My fiancé and I get disgusted looks when we hold hands walking into places.”\n\nI mentioned Brooklyn earlier when I was talking about climes unlike Pawleys Island because Dennis Williams, an executive with HBO who lives in the borough’s Boerum Hill neighborhood, was on my mind. He, too, is a gay dad, although unmarried. At 44, he’s just a year younger than Starling. But his experience is worlds apart.\n\nBrooklyn, N.Y. “I get the, ‘Oh, there’s no mom?’ But then it’s like they’re proud of me.” I can’t think of a single instance when anyone has been weird or I’ve had to confront any kind of homophobia. I don’t know that I could find this level of reinforced diversity outside of where I am now. Dennis Williams 44, unmarried gay father of a 3-year-old Pawleys Island, S.C. “Somebody said that our kids should be taken away from us and we should be hanged.” If it wasn’t for my husband’s job, we wouldn’t be here. We’re constantly under a microscope, two dads raising kids. We were featured in a local publication and some comments were really nasty. Tommy Starling 45, married gay father of two children, ages 4 and 11\n\nHe told me that if he draws looks from other parents when he’s out and about with his 3-year-old son, Elan, he’s pretty sure it’s because he’s a black man and there has been so much discussion about black children growing up with absent fathers. Acquaintances who learn or know that he’s gay don’t register any surprise or signal any disapproval.\n\n“I don’t take this for granted,” he added, noting that he grew up in Kansas and knows gay men in cities less cosmopolitan than New York.\n\n33 7 states have laws prohibiting gestational surrogacy states do not have a law explicitly allowing a second same-sex parent to adopt Source: Human Rights Campaign 33 7 states do not have a law explicitly allowing a second same-sex parent to adopt states have laws prohibiting gestational surrogacy Source: Human Rights Campaign\n\nOf course there are enclaves in Kansas where Williams would find a warm welcome. The college town of Lawrence has a municipal ordinance prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, even though Kansas itself doesn’t. (In 2015, Gov. Sam Brownback rescinded one that covered only public employees.) And there are rural pockets of upstate New York that have none of Brooklyn’s progressivism or diversity.\n\nThe geographic variations for transgender people may well be the starkest.\n\nRockville, Md. “We have great equality laws in Maryland, which is unusual in its protections for trans people.” I’ve been tolerated. I’ve even been welcomed. I have a dog, and I remember one gentleman coming up with his dog and asking, “Are you a transgender?” I said, nervously, “Yes.” And he said, “Well, good on ya!” Stevie Neal 63, transgender woman living just outside Washington, D.C. Peyton, Colo. “I’ve gotten slurs. ‘Y’all should be put to death.’ This is just walking down the street.” Ten miles away from me is the Focus on the Family headquarters, which we, in the L.G.B.T. community, consider a hate group. I get the feeling there are people who want to hurt me. I’ve had people brandish guns at me. Jamie Shea 39, transgender woman living near Colorado Springs\n\nOn the state level, the yardsticks for measuring respect for L.G.B.T. people include, recently, restrictions on “conversion therapy,” which attempts to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. More and more mental health professionals are speaking out unequivocally about its dangers, and more and more state legislatures are outlawing it for minors. New Mexico, Nevada, Rhode Island and Connecticut did so in recent months; New Jersey, Vermont, Illinois, Oregon, California and the District of Columbia had previously done so. But that leaves 41 states without any such prohibition.\n\nThe geographic variations for transgender people may well be the starkest. Harper Jean Tobin, the policy director for the National Center for Transgender Equality, noted that there are states — Nevada, for one — where changing your designated gender on a government document requires only affidavits from people who know you. “It can be a medical provider, your therapist, your minister, your parent,” Tobin said. But other states, like Tennessee and Alabama, demand proof of surgery and a physician’s signature.\n\n4 41 33 49 states have laws prohibiting transgender people from receiving documents reflecting their gender identity states don’t have laws protecting youths from conversion therapy states don’t have explicit bans on excluding trans individuals from receiving health insurance coverage states don’t have laws for gender-neutral single-occupancy restrooms Source: Human Rights Campaign 41 33 states don’t have laws protecting youths from conversion therapy states don’t have explicit bans on excluding trans individuals from receiving health insurance coverage 4 49 states have laws prohibiting transgender people from receiving documents reflecting their gender identity states don’t have laws for gender-neutral single-occupancy restrooms Source: Human Rights Campaign Source: Human Rights Campaign 41 49 states don’t have laws protecting youths from conversion therapy states don’t have laws for gender-neutral single-occupancy restrooms 4 33 states have laws prohibiting transgender people from receiving documents reflecting their gender identity states don’t have explicit bans on excluding trans individuals from receiving health insurance coverage Source: Human Rights Campaign\n\nAh, Alabama. In May, under the aegis of “religious freedom,” its governor signed a law that allowed taxpayer-funded adoption agencies to deny the placement of children in homes with gay parents. Patricia Todd, 62, who serves in the state’s House of Representatives, remembers the heated discussion there beforehand, because she played a special role. She’s openly lesbian — the only open L.G.B.T. person ever in the Alabama Legislature.\n\nAlabama “I’m the only open L.G.B.T. person ever in the State Legislature.” I tell people, “This is my missionary work, and I want to be in the hardest place to do it, and I will not live in Mississippi.” I love the South: the culture, the food, the people. It’s the politics I want to change. Patricia Todd State representative, 62, lesbian California “There are four L.G.B.T. people in the Senate and four of us in the Assembly.” It’s the all-time high. The interesting thing is now our straight allies are carrying a lot of our L.G.B.T. bills. Sometimes even my opponents will say, “I never understood that. That’s a new perspective.” Ricardo Lara State senator, 42, gay\n\n“I tried to stop the bill as best I could,” Representative Todd told me. “I practically had the sponsor in tears when we were debating this on the floor.” Why? “Because he really likes me. They all really like me. I said, ‘I want everyone to realize: If you vote in favor of this, you’re telling me that I’m not fit to be a parent. And I want you to look at me. You know me.’ ”\n\nThe Alabama House voted 60 to 14 in favor of the bill, after which the Alabama Senate voted 23 to 9.","author":"Frank Bruni","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-25T09:21:01.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/24/opinion/sunday/worst-and-best-places-to-be-gay-1503633763145/worst-and-best-places-to-be-gay-1503633763145-facebookJumbo-v5.png","digest":"S51WA9wBeBgAkhBr/zrICw==\n"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"59a1f410d579a51254729ed6"},"description":"As Hurricane Harvey bears down on Texas’ Gulf Coast, the threat of flooding looms large in Houston, as its geography, developments and drainage systems make storms a particular danger to the area.","title":"Five Reasons Houston Is Especially Vulnerable to Flooding","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-reasons-houston-is-especially-vulnerable-to-flooding-1503676480","text":"First responders escorted a woman out of a flooded Houston highway on Jan. 18. Incidents of high water have occurred more frequently in the city, exacerbated by its drainage systems, geography and developments. Photo: Elizabeth Conley/Associated Press\n\nAs many cities in the South and along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts have grown in recent decades, they have also become much more prone to flooding. Now, as Hurricane Harvey bears down on Texas’ Gulf Coast, Houston’s vulnerability is highlighted, as the city’s 800 miles of creeks and bayous—and its burgeoning developments—make storms a particular threat.\n\n1. Houston’s geography makes rising waters particularly dangerous\n\nThe city is low-lying and most of the soil is clay, which drains poorly, said Samuel Brody, director of the Texas A\u0026M University’s Institute for Sustainable Coastal Communities in Galveston. That is in contrast to Miami which has sandy, porous soils. In Houston, “the underlying physical conditions play a role in exacerbating the impacts of floods,” Mr. Brody said.\n\n2. A recent construction boom has impeded drainage\n\nLarge-scale developments—such as apartment and office complexes, shopping malls and roads—have added vast stretches of pavement to the Houston area. These expanses of concrete and asphalt inhibit drainage and worsen flooding, as, when heavy downpours hit, the rain flows into other neighborhoods rather than into the soil.\n\nAs Hurricane Harvey lands on the coast of Texas, here’s four things you need to know about the Category 3 storm. Photo: NASA\n\n3. Flood protections have had trouble keeping pace with development\n\nWhile flood protections have been strengthened in the region in recent years, local officials have been perpetually trying to catch up in newly developed areas where the effects of higher water levels are less known. Lax building regulations in the area also have allowed subdivisions to be built where flooding was inevitable, experts have said.\n\n4. Building regulations haven’t taken into account historic flooding levels\n\nNew buildings erected in Houston are required to be built at 12 inches above 100-year-flooding levels—meaning there is a 1% chance of that the area will be inundated within a single year. Harris County, Texas—in which Houston is located—requires new buildings to be built at 18 inches above 100-year flood levels. But recent flooding in some parts of Harris County, reached 250-year- and 500-year-flooding levels, and Mr. Brody notes that almost half of insured flood claims are outside the flood plain boundaries.\n\n5. Drainage systems are largely obsolete\n\nThe region is also weighed down by its outdated drainage systems. Its network of channels was built beginning in the early 20th Century to sustain only a 10-year flood, a milder—but more likely—event. Local officials have worked to widen existing drainage channels, but retrofitting them to a 25-year-flooding level is costly.\n\nWrite to Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.com and Cameron McWhirter at cameron.mcwhirter@wsj.com","author":"Dan Frosch","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-25T15:54:00.000Z"},"source":"the-wall-street-journal","urlToImage":"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-UV132_2V51I_TOP_20170825105455.jpg","digest":"i9HlJpYZPQJlydnU3GkzQA==\n"}

Rick Wilking/Reuters 1 of 23 • • • • •\n\nROCKPORT, Texas—Hurricane Harvey pounded Texas on Saturday with torrential rain and high winds, threatening catastrophic flooding, though the storm was gradually losing strength after hitting the coast late Friday.\n\nBy midday Saturday, after a night of rattling winds and sheets of rain, Harvey had been downgraded to a tropical storm from a Category 4 hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center. The center continued to warn of catastrophic flooding as the storm hovered over the state.\n\nLocal officials in Rockport, Texas, the small coastal city near where Harvey made landfall Friday night, said they knew of one death but declined to give details. Damage to the town was extensive, they said, and 40% of the city’s approximately 20,000 residents had decided to stay and ride out the storm.\n\nThe storm hit between Port Aransas, just outside Corpus Christi, and Port O’Connor to the north, and was expected to settle in over South Texas for several days. Forecasters warned it could bring up to 40 inches of rain in some places and potentially cause devastating flooding in cities like Houston.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said Saturday that while the storm’s winds have subsided, the worst of the damage could be yet to come as rains and floods take their toll.\n\n“Now that the hurricane has come on shore, our primary concern remains dramatic flooding,” said Mr. Abbott. More than a foot of rain has already fallen on the coastal area between Corpus Christi and Houston, and another 20 to 30 inches is expected.\n\n“That is coming down on already saturated ground and already filled up waterways, whether they be creeks, bayous or rivers. There is the potential for very dramatic flooding,” Mr. Abbott said.\n\nThe sheer volume of water was already beginning to push waterways above their banks. On Saturday morning, Fort Bend County officials ordered a mandatory evacuation around the San Bernard River and issued a voluntary evacuation around the Brazos River, according to Mr. Abbott.\n\nHigh winds have left 338,000 homes without power and Mr. Abbott said it would be “several days, perhaps, before those outages can be addressed.”\n\nOn Saturday, Rockport, a small fishing and resort community that bore the brunt of Harvey, was left crippled by the storm. Tangles of power lines and the carcasses of hulking oak trees that had fallen Friday night cluttered the town’s narrow streets. Roofs, garage doors and in some cases entire homes were crumpled. Coffee cans, bed lamps and sneakers spilled out onto flooded roads, The stench of gas hung over the town, as emergency crews picked through the rubble, the belching of toads echoing from the muck.\n\nThe storm was the first substantial hurricane to hit Texas since Hurricane Ike struck the Gulf Coast in 2008. The last Category 4 storm to hit Texas was Hurricane Carla in 1961, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nUtilities were reporting widespread power outages on Saturday, some of which could last for days, emergency officials said.\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power early Saturday morning, according to Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the state’s power grid, said Saturday.\n\nLarry Sinclair, a commander with the Rockport Police Department, said damage in at least some parts of city was significant. He and officers and emergency workers were trying to assess the extent of the damage to buildings and checking to see whether anyone was trapped inside. He said wind conditions were making it difficult to evaluate the level of devastation the city and its residents had suffered.\n\n“We were pretty much ground zero,” he said.\n\nEarly Saturday, Corpus Christi officials warned residents to reduce the use of toilets and faucets as the power outage had affected the city’s wastewater-treatment plant. A boil advisory was in effect for water use in the city, which has about 325,000 residents.\n\nIn some areas around the city, warped power lines teetered toward the ground, toppled trees and palm leaves were strewn across streets and some street signals dangled lifelessly with no power. Several roads leading into the city were littered with broken street signs, which had been uprooted and tossed from their moorings.\n\nAs steady rain fell at noon Saturday, Anselmo “Ace” Calvillo, 53, and his girlfriend, Aime Dimas, were outside their yellow bungalow a few blocks from the beach on Causeway Boulevard, in Corpus Christi North Beach, grilling chicken and ribs. They lost power around 2 a.m.\n\nThe couple, who have lived in Corpus for 11 years, said they decided to weather the storm at home for fear of looters. They boarded the windows with scrap wood and settled in. Ms. Dimas said she was scared as the storm raged, creating a sound “like a train.” “The bedroom window, that’s where we sat and watched everything,” Mr. Calvillo added. “The sound shook the ground.” Their home made it through largely unscathed.\n\nLocal officials expressed relief that the storm hadn’t made a direct impact here on Friday night. Most of Nueces County was still standing, said County Judge Loyd Neal.\n\n“We’re very fortunate,” he said, adding, that the county hadn’t received any reports of fatalities, which he called “amazing.”\n\nInto the Oil Patch Harvey’s projected path crosses one of the busiest areas of the petroleum industry.

That 2012 disaster helped to push the National Flood Insurance Program into the red, where it remains. Photo: Kevin Hagen for The Wall Street Journal\n\nHurricane Harvey poses new hazards to a giant U.S. flood insurer already facing mounting debt and a reauthorization fight in Congress.\n\nThe National Flood Insurance Program, created about 50 years ago because private insurers were unwilling to risk catastrophic flood losses, could be inundated with billions of new claims following Harvey’s initial Category 4 winds and colossal rainfall.\n\nYet the U.S. program is scheduled to expire on Sept. 30 and has just $5.8 billion left it can borrow from the Treasury to meet new claims, according to January figures reported to Congress. Many people buy the government policies through private-sector insurers, which are compensated for that service.\n\nMembers of Congress are discussing a number of options, ranging from a temporary renewal of the program to a more-comprehensive fix designed to return the program to solvency. Congress returns from recess on Sept. 5.\n\n“From a public-policy perspective, Hurricane Harvey reinforces the narrative of why the national flood-insurance program is so important and needs to be addressed,” said Christopher Gillott, legislative director of Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.).\n\nWhat makes the debate in Washington, D.C. so challenging is that the program already has a debt of roughly $25 billion from earlier weather disasters. Much of that is from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and superstorm Sandy in 2012. Sandy alone cost $8.4 billion initially, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which manages the program.\n\nThe program had to borrow another $1.6 billion from the Treasury in January just to pay interest on its debt and storm claims, according to FEMA.\n\nIt will take days, if not weeks or longer, for claims to emerge from Hurricane Harvey. More than 200,000 homes along the Texas coast could be at risk, according to information and analytics firm CoreLogic . In 30 Texas counties labeled disaster areas by the state’s governor there are nearly 450,000 NFIP policies covering $125.7 billion in insured value, according to the program’s website. More than half of that value is in heavily populated Harris County, which includes Houston.\n\nPrevious interruptions of the flood-insurance program have triggered delays in thousands of home sales during the lapses.\n\nSticking points in Congress include whether lawmakers will address the federal program’s finances in part by increasing rates gradually for homeowners who currently pay well below the actuarial risk of flooding.\n\nProgram critics have said many policyholders are getting bargain rates compared with what private-sector insurers would require and that taxpayers in drier parts of the country are subsidizing those in flood-prone states.\n\nRoughly a dozen senators are proposing legislation that would adjust homeowners’ rates to be more in line with a property’s risk, and create incentives for private insurers to take on more policies. But that package, led by Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.), is unlikely to pass next month since Congress would have only a few weeks to address it, according to Senate staff members.\n\nThe two top leaders of the Senate Banking Committee recently introduced a separate, simpler bill: It would renew the program for six years without getting into the more controversial financial woes. Lawmakers are also now discussing a shorter renewal period to extend the program to December, according to Senate staff members.\n\n“A short-term extension will at least give us an opportunity to address the program sooner rather than doing a longer-term extension that would kick the can down the road,” said Jason Tuber, senior adviser to Mr. Menendez.\n\nMore-traditional home insurers are increasingly willing to take on flood exposure instead of leaving that risk to the federal government—thanks to improved flood models, satellite imagery and other tools.\n\n“We developed a comfort level in underwriting it,” said Matthew Power, a senior executive at American International Group Inc., among the private-sector carriers with an alternative to the federal policies.\n\nBut the private-sector market isn’t big enough to fill the gap if the U.S. government were to let the federal insurance program lapse. AIG for now has about 20,000 flood-insurance policyholders nationwide. The U.S. program, by comparison, has roughly 5 million policyholders.\n\nCraig Poulton, chief executive of Poulton Associates, which administers a private flood-insurance program, estimates that private primary flood insurance represents about 2% of the market.\n\nImagery of Harvey’s flooding will show “that there needs to be [a federal program] to assist both individuals and businesses to rebound from flooding and severe storm damage,” said Elizabeth Guimaraes, who chairs an external-affairs committee for the Risk and Insurance Management Society and is director of risk management at Nova Southeastern University in Florida.\n\n—Nicole Friedman contributed to this article.","author":"Rachel Witkowski and Leslie Scism","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T18:21:00.000Z"},"source":"the-wall-street-journal","urlToImage":"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-UI411_NYSAND_SOC_20170718161942.jpg","digest":"wqjViHeLy5PicM5LamnoVg==\n"}

Eric Gay/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nOn social media, residents and others who rode out the storm in Rockport shared images of downed trees, collapsed buildings and darkened streets. Also suffering severe damage was the small island community of Port Aransas, which caught the edge of the eye of the hurricane.\n\nThe storm made landfall at 10 p.m. Central time Friday with 130 mph winds — the first Category 4 storm to hit the United States since Charley in 2004. By late morning Saturday, Harvey had lost some of its punch, but still had hurricane-force winds of 80 mph, having drifted to about 25 miles west of the inland city of Victoria. Shortly after noon, the National Hurricane Center downgraded Harvey to a tropical storm, with sustained winds of 70 mph.\n\nThe storm remains dangerous, because as predicted, it has become virtually stuck in place, giving Texas no respite from the deluge. The center of the storm on Saturday morning crept along at just 2 mph. By Saturday afternoon, with winds of 65 mph, it was 45 miles west-northwest of Victoria, Tex., and came to a halt.\n\nIn the coming days, forecasters believe the tropical storm will meander south and east, and possibly slip back out over the hot Gulf waters, allowing it to restrengthen to some extent. All the while it will dump what could be historic quantities of rain.\n\n[The latest reports on the storm]\n\nThe National Weather Service predicted total rain accumulations of 15 to 30 inches in many areas, with as much as 40 inches in isolated areas. Most ominously, the area around Rockport could see up to 60 inches of rain through midweek.\n\n“Please take the flooding threat seriously,” the National Weather Service tweeted. “Remember, this is a multiday event … marathon not a sprint …”\n\nCapital Weather Gang's Jason Samenow breaks down the three main threats from Harvey: Torrential downpours, a storm surge and heavy winds. (Claritza Jimenez,Jason Samenow/The Washington Post)\n\nGov. Greg Abbott (R) said he had declared 50 counties a disaster area. With the storm now ashore, he said, “our primary concern remains dramatic flooding.” He urged citizens to follow the familiar advice: “Turn around, don’t drown.”\n\nThe governor spoke to reporters two levels below ground in a bunker-like room at the State Operations Center in Austin. He spent much of the brief news conference praising the resilience of evacuees he’d met the day before in San Antonio, saying they were happy to be alive but worried about their homes and possessions in coastal communities.\n\nMore than 200,000 people across the state were without power early Saturday, and wastewater and drinking-water treatment plants here were offline.\n\nThe National Weather Service predicted “major flood” conditions at some 49 rivers across a vast region of south and southeast Texas.\n\nThe Tres Palacios River has already risen more than 20 feet near Midfield, Texas, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The San Bernard River near the town of Sweeny is expected to rise more than 10 feet above its 1998 record flood stage. The Brazos River is expected to break a flood record set just last year, and officials have ordered mandatory evacuations in low-lying areas of Fort Bend County.\n\nAmong the cities at risk of major flooding is Houston, the nation’s fourth largest with a population in excess of 2 million. Early Saturday morning, the city was buffeted by waves of torrential rain and lightning followed by periods of calm.\n\nIn the southwest part of the city, Brays Bayou was swelling with fast-flowing, debris-filled brown water, and a tornado touched down in a suburban neighborhood.\n\nMontry Ray was staying up late to ride out the storm with his wife and two children when the roaring sound of the tornado sent them running for cover in a bathroom. Just as they bolted from the master bedroom, the storm exploded through its wall, embedding bricks in the drywall across the room. The storm ripped open the roof.\n\n“You know how they say you hear the train noise?” said 12-year-old Caden Hill, who lives down the street. “I heard it.”\n\nHe, along with about 50 neighbors, turned out Saturday morning to help clean up. Volunteers chopped fallen trees, hauled away crumpled fences and gathered debris while roofers patched the homes.\n\nIn Corpus Christi, the storm ripped shingles and satellite dishes off roofs, but the city did not appear to have suffered major destruction, Mayor Joe McComb said. The power outage disrupted the city’s wastewater treatment plant, and officials are asking residents to boil drinking water until further notice.\n\n“The storm surge never happened, but the winds came in a whole lot higher than anyone predicted,” McComb said. “Some areas also got hit with pretty hard rain, but I was impressed with how little rain we had at my house.”\n\nThe 20-story Holiday Inn Marina hotel, where many relief workers and journalists rode out the storm, reported that it was running low on food. A note in the lobby and in elevators asked guests to use their own “emergency” food and water supplies before purchasing the hotel’s dwindling supplies. The hotel is a major staging area for Red Cross officials, who flew into the city ahead of the storm.\n\n[Follow Capital Weather Gang for the latest forecast on Harvey]\n\nSan Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg urged residents to continue to stay off the roads as Harvey neared the city and brought wind gusts up to 60 mph and heavy rain. The city is under a flash flood watch and tropical storm warning.\n\n“We don’t want anyone in San Antonio to let their guard down,” Nirenberg said.\n\nThe city closed 10 roads in the area due to high water, and officials expect that number to grow.\n\nWeather officials took to social media and the airwaves Saturday in an effort to persuade people not to be lulled by a false sense of security by the relatively muted impact so far in places away from the Rockport area.\n\nIn Galveston, a city that lived through the last big Texas hurricane — Ike in 2008 — residents seemed unconcerned.\n\n“We thought it was going to be much worse,” said Latoya Fulton, 33, who was eating breakfast with her husband and four children at Waffle House. The Fultons, who live in Galveston, spent Friday night in a hotel in Conroe, north of Houston, as a precaution. But they returned Saturday morning to their undamaged house when news reports made it clear that Galveston had been largely spared from the hurricane’s winds.\n\nA few tables over at the packed restaurant — one of the few businesses open in the area — Galveston residents Dottie and Kevin Bowden ate breakfast with their 16-year-old granddaughter, Savannah Stewart.\n\n“This ain’t nothing,” Kevin Bowden said.\n\nAll the houses in their neighborhood are built on stilts, so they weren’t worried about flooding, and local officials did not issue a mandatory evacuation order. Everyone in the neighborhood stayed to ride out the storm.\n\n“We’re not crazy,” said Dottie, 63, who runs a business cleaning rental properties. “If they told us to leave, we would have.”\n\n“And this isn’t our first rodeo,” added her husband, 56, who manages personal investments.\n\nRain was still slashing down in intermittent waves, and Galveston authorities still had flash-flood warnings in place. The forecast was for potentially severe rain to continue for days.\n\nKevin Bowden said the biggest problem so far was that “we’re running low on Corona.”\n\nFarther east, the hurricane has put officials in New Orleans and across Louisiana on alert, and Gov. John Bel Edwards said Saturday that it could be a week before the state has to cope with flooding. He said the pumping system in New Orleans, which flooded earlier this month after a heavy downpour, is steadily improving. “We’re a long ways from being out of the woods, but we are very thankful it hasn’t been more severe up to now,” he said of the storm.\n\nPresident Trump Friday night signed a disaster proclamation for Texas after Gov. Abbott sent him a written request saying that “Texas is about to experience one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the state.” White House aides said that Trump would visit Texas next week.\n\nTrump said in a series of tweets Saturday morning that he is closely monitoring the situation from Camp David and that federal officials have been on the ground since before the storm hit. He urged residents to “be safe” and pledged a thorough federal response. “We are leaving nothing to chance,” he wrote. “City, State and Federal Govs. working great together!”\n\n[As Hurricane Harvey slams into state, Texans hunker down]\n\nSullivan reported from Houston and Galveston.

It is basically stationary — no longer moving in any direction. It is centered about 45 miles west-northwest of Victoria, Tex, where an 83 mph gust was reported at 9 a.m.\n\nFriday night, Hurricane Hunters reported a pressure as low as 938 millibars — exceptionally low when compared to average pressure around 1,000 millibars. The eye of the storm is filling in and the winds are weakening, but its outer rain bands are dealing a blow to Southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana.\n\nAt least eight tornadoes have been reported to the National Weather Service on Friday and Saturday, including one that flipped a camper in Hackberry, La.\n\nHackberry Tornado captured by Robby Trahan. Report one camper flipped, another structure hit. #lawx @NWSLakeCharles pic.twitter.com/wHBPgOxZEt — Zack Fradella (@ZackFradellaWx) August 26, 2017\n\nWhere is Harvey going?\n\nThe short answer is that the storm isn’t going anywhere. Harvey is expected to stall for the better part of the upcoming week, penetrating inland perhaps 20 or 30 miles from its current position before finally jogging northeast around Thursday. This is essentially a worst-case scenario for already-waterlogged areas from Port Lavaca, Tex., up toward Houston, where between one and three feet of additional rain will fall in the days ahead.\n\nMake no mistake: Even though Harvey’s wind threat has largely diminished, this is a disaster in the making. By Sunday afternoon, many areas may be inaccessible due to floodwaters, isolated to all but those traveling by boat. Now is the time to move to higher ground or evacuate if at all possible.\n\nMeanwhile, attention also turns to a tornado risk. Circulations within the spiral rain bands on the outer edge of tropical cyclones often derive wind shear from their parent circulations, sometimes spinning up tornadoes by the dozen. These quick-hitting twisters appear most likely along the coastline near Galveston, Tex., on Saturday, before the threat expands inland in areal coverage Saturday night. Have a way to get notified if warnings are issued.\n\nWhere has Harvey been?\n\nHurricane Harvey meandered ashore just north of Port Aransas, Tex., on Friday night and early Saturday, lashing many coastal communities with sustained winds of 110 mph and gusts topping 130 mph. The slow-moving nature of the storm meant an extended beating for many coastal communities, collapsing buildings and inundating shorelines with its storm surge.\n\nSome of the top recorded wind gusts with #Harvey as it made landfall last night. Some places probably saw higher gusts! #wfaaweather pic.twitter.com/zpPsaequRl — Pete Delkus (@wfaaweather) August 26, 2017\n\nThe storm surge raised water levels at least six feet above normally dry land in Port Lavaca, Tex.\n\nHarvey is only the fourth landfalling Category 4 or 5 hurricane in the United States since 1970, joining the elite ranks of Andrew, Hugo and Charley, and far surpassing Katrina and Sandy in power upon moving ashore. The incredible strength of Harvey’s winds even prompted the issuance of the second-ever Extreme Wind Warning, a revamped product forecasters dusted off to warn residents of imminent “tornado-like winds” at the tempest’s core.\n\nDawn in Rockport, #Texas.

Extreme storm chaser Jeff Piotrowski worried viewers when his live stream suddenly went black amid 125 mph winds in the eyewall, while a National Geographic reporter crashed nearby and was told by sheltered first responders he was “on his own” (he was later rescued).\n\nMeanwhile the Fairfield Inn and Suites, where more than 100 media personnel had converged to document the storm, experienced a partial building collapse, forcing chasers to relocate to a hurricane center as the eye passed overhead.","author":"Jason Samenow, Angela Fritz, Matthew Cappucci, Jason Samenow, Angela Fritz, Matthew Cappucci","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T09:54:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/files/2017/08/rbtop0-10.gif\u0026w=1484\u0026op=resize\u0026opt=1\u0026filter=antialias\u0026t=20170517","digest":"9g7lxM2DSqDkAce1IRC3RQ==\n"}

He has chosen to be a divider, not a uniter, no matter how many words to the contrary he reads off a teleprompter or from a prepared script. That’s one obvious message from Friday’s decision to issue a pardon for controversial former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio.\n\nTrump has been a divisive force from the very start of his campaign for president, a proud disrupter of the political status quo. His swashbuckling contempt for political correctness and the rules of the game endeared him to millions of Americans who were fed up with Washington, with career politicians, with liberal elites and with the mainstream media. The more he is under fire — as he is now — the more he returns to that strategy.\n\nThere is little doubt that his decision to seize on the issue of immigration, particularly illegal immigration, helped fuel his successful run to the White House. It’s an issue that resonates far beyond the nation’s southern border.\n\nAccidentally or intentionally, Trump tapped into fear and anger over immigration that existed in many parts of the country, including Midwestern states where electoral votes gave him the presidency.\n\nHis willingness to use issues of culture and identity to rally supporters, even as his words and actions repelled critics, was a strategic success. There are other reasons he won the election, but immigration is a central factor.\n\nJoe Arpaio's illegal-immigration crackdown made him a polarizing figure and an early ally of President Trump. (Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nIllegal immigration long has been a divisive issue in American politics. Securing the border, fulfilling the needs of many businesses for migrant workers and deciding how to justly treat the millions of undocumented immigrants already in the country — some have been here for decades and are rooted in their communities — has defied political solution. Politicians in both parties have tried and failed for years to find middle ground and thereby tamp down the conflicts that have arisen.\n\n[Trump issues pardon for former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio]\n\nTrump’s views have not been in doubt. As a candidate, he condemned Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals. He called for a ban on Muslim immigration. He attacked a federal judge overseeing a suit against Trump University, claiming the judge could not be impartial because he was of Mexican heritage.\n\nHis policies in office have brought a sharp change from those of the Obama administration. From his entry ban aimed at several Muslim-majority countries to raids that have shaken immigrant communities, Trump has had a demonstrable impact.\n\nIt is a promise he made that he is keeping, even though he has yet to get Congress to fund the border wall that was a rallying cry during his campaign. The Trump administration is now weighing whether to end the Obama administration’s policy designed to protect children from deportation — known informally as “Dreamers” — who were brought to the country illegally, the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\n\nIn pardoning Arpaio, the president has again linked himself to the most extreme elements of the immigration debate, inflaming an already highly volatile situation. The pardon was an extraordinary act coming so early in a presidency and sets a tone both on immigration and on the president’s willingness to use this power to take care of those who have been loyal to him. That is something that could come into play in the future, depending on the outcome of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nArpaio made his reputation as an uncompromising sheriff whose harsh treatment of undocumented immigrants over many years drew criticism, condemnation and eventually legal action. He became a national symbol in the immigration debate — loved, reviled and unrepentant. He defied a judge’s order to stop racially profiling Latinos in his state. When he kept on with the practice, he was eventually convicted of criminal contempt, a misdemeanor. Now he has been pardoned.\n\nPresident Donald Trump gestures to the crowd while speaking at a rally Tuesday in Phoenix. (Rick Scuteri/AP)\n\nOnce the speculation about a pardon for Arpaio surfaced, the endgame was never in doubt. It was certainly not in question after what Trump said during his angry, off-script performance in Phoenix on Tuesday night. He wouldn’t say the exact words at the time and would not use the rally to announce the decision, but his intention was clear. “I’ll make a prediction,” he said of Arpaio that night. “He’s going to be just fine.”\n\n[Joe Arpaio’s record on illegal immigration]\n\nNonetheless, when the pardon came down, the decision created a fresh controversy for a president already embattled. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has felt the political blowback of anti-illegal-immigration forces whenever he has tried to help craft a comprehensive legislative solution, and who has tangled regularly with Trump, was one of the first to condemn the move.\n\n“Mr. Arpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt for continuing to illegally profile Latinos living in Arizona based on their perceived immigration status in violation of a judge’s orders,” McCain, who is being treated for brain cancer, said in a statement released Friday night. “The president has the authority to make this pardon, but doing so at this time undermines his claim for the respect of rule of law as Mr. Arpaio has shown no remorse for his actions.”\n\nWhat was perhaps unexpected was the timing of the pardon. For starters, it came only days after the president had delivered a speech about national unity before the American Legion in Reno, Nev.\n\nThat speech was Trump’s latest effort to undo the damage from his multiple statements after the white-supremacist march in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. Criticized for failing to unequivocally condemn neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan at the time, he has tried both to rewrite the history of what he actually said and issue calls for unity.\n\nIn Reno, he called on everyone to help “heal the wounds that have divided us, and to seek a new unity based on the common values that unite us.” The pardon for Arpaio put that speech into fresh context. Actions speak louder than words.\n\nWhat also was unexpected was that Trump decided to announce the pardon as Hurricane Harvey was bearing down on Texas. At a time when the public would expect the president to stay fully focused on the well-being of people in harm’s way of a powerful storm, he chose to divert the country’s attention by stirring controversy elsewhere.\n\nEver since his election, Trump has had the opportunity to try to expand his coalition, to reach beyond his base and to increase the size of his governing constituency. His electoral margin was comfortable enough, but three of the states that tipped the balance — Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin — were decided by less than a percentage point, and he lost the national popular vote to Hillary Clinton. That’s a fragile basis from which to govern.\n\nGiven those realities, a prudent politician presumably would seek ways to draw more voters into his or her orbit. Trump consistently has done the opposite, with actions designed to bind himself ever more tightly to the constituency that elected him at the cost of permanently losing potential supporters. The Arpaio pardon fits that pattern in bold colors.","author":"Dan Balz, Dan Balz","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T17:28:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/26/National-Politics/Images/2017-08-26T140017Z_1443009499_RC1EE92CBDE0_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-ARPAIO.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"aqfqXrs+PkZY5rkUIhtb7w==\n"}

He may be helping Democrats take the House.","title":"Analysis | Trump looks to 2020 but a more immediate peril looms: Democratic control, and impeachment power, in the House","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/trump-looks-to-2020-but-a-more-immediate-peril-looms-democratic-control-and-impeachment-power-in-the-house/2017/08/25/c4fe5046-89dd-11e7-a50f-e0d4e6ec070a_story.html","text":"Some of President Trump’s advisers want him to bet his political future on a strategy that was most recently used by one of his most bitter rivals: President Bill Clinton.\n\nAs he picks fights with his own party’s congressional leaders, Trump is adopting his own version of “triangulation,” trying to forge a separate and distinct identity from both Republicans and Democrats. These advisers believe that dysfunction on Capitol Hill is likely to continue and that the further away Trump is positioned from the gridlock, the better his political standing will be heading toward his own reelection campaign in 2020.\n\n“It’s right out of the Bill Clinton playbook. Triangulation is something that he perfected,” Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, told The Washington Post’s Philip Rucker this week.\n\nThe key difference is timing, and that’s what makes Trump’s bid, for now, so much more risky than what Clinton did as he prepared for his 1996 reelection campaign. Clinton’s move away from congressional Democrats came after a brutal 1994 midterm election that gave Republicans full control of the Capitol.\n\nTrump is making a preemptive break with his would-be congressional allies barely seven months into office. This comes more than a year ahead of the 2018 midterm elections and at a moment when his party has control of both the House and Senate.\n\nDemocrats are openly suggesting President Trump could be impeached. Here's how it would actually happen. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nAnd he’s doing it in a scathingly personal manner, attacking congressional Republicans nearly daily through social media and at public rallies.\n\nTrump’s advisers contend that the strategy will inoculate him from blame if Republicans lose big-time next year. But what they don’t seem to take into account is that constantly blaming GOP leaders for their failures could depress conservative turnout next year and ensure a Democratic takeover, at least in the House, which current election ratings place within closer reach of Democratic control than the Senate.\n\nAnd that scenario presents far greater peril for Trump than mere blame for electoral losses. A Democratic House majority would have the power to move on impeachment proceedings. The gavel of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee would go to Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), a shrewd operator who would have subpoena power to go after the president’s personal taxes and peruse how much the Trump Organization is benefiting from foreign governments staying at his hotel properties.\n\nAnd forget about funding for a wall along the Mexican border: Democrats running the House Appropriations Committee would not even entertain that idea.\n\nSome of Trump’s advisers have cautioned him about the possibility of impeachment proceedings. But others view this internecine fighting with Republicans as the best course.\n\nTrump distances himself from GOP lawmakers to avoid blame if agenda stalls\n\n“No one likes the Congress. No one likes the Republican or Democratic leadership. He puts the blame for inaction where it belongs,” Roger Stone, an outside agitator who remains close to Trump, told Rucker.\n\nTrump has put that strategy to work almost every morning during the past couple of weeks by using his Twitter account to attack Republicans on Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been the most frequent target lately, after coming up one vote short of extending the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Over the past few days, he found a new foil in Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), lashing out at the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his comments questioning whether Trump could ever succeed.\n\nThere is some evidence that the public distinguishes Trump from both parties. In late spring, just 38 percent of the public believed that Trump is “in touch with the concerns of most people,” according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.\n\nBut for the Republican Party, that number drops to 32 percent, and just 28 percent of Americans believe that the Democratic Party is “in touch” with average citizens.\n\n“They are equally hated in the country,” Stone said.\n\nThe irony of Trump adopting a Bill Clinton strategy is rich. At his lowest moment in the 2016 campaign, after The Post revealed Trump’s 2005 comments bragging about unwanted sexual advances, Trump pointed the finger at Bill Clinton’s extramarital affairs and brought some of Clinton’s accusers to one of his debates against Hillary Clinton.\n\nClinton survived his scandals — and even an impeachment — in part because he maintained strong personal relationships with many congressional Democrats, never openly antagonizing them the way Trump does with fellow Republicans.\n\nIn the run-up to the 1996 election, Clinton signed a Republican-drafted bill setting time limits on federal welfare benefits and pushed pet conservative causes such as uniforms in public schools. In his second term, he cinched a stringent budget deal with House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and normalized trade relations with China.\n\nBut on some core party issues such as protecting Medicare and Social Security, Clinton fought Republicans and beat them. He campaigned for Democrats when they asked, raised gobs of money for their political committees and did the little personal things including inviting them out to play golf.\n\nThose close bonds paid dividends during the 1998-99 impeachment effort, as Democrats rallied behind Clinton. Not a single Senate Democrat supported any of the articles of impeachment during a trial that ended in deadlock.\n\nIt’s too early to know if Democrats would move toward impeachment if they won the House majority next year. But they could wreak havoc on Trump’s agenda and shed light on his personal finances.\n\nCummings would become a national figure overnight, capable of launching investigations and holding televised hearings that would probably be very damaging. Any bold Trump agenda items would be blocked by House Democrats, who would force legislative compromises that would crush conservative spirits.\n\nDemocrats would force Trump into legislative compromises that would dispirit conservatives base voters for the GOP.\n\nThose prospects would seem to compel Trump to work with Republicans now to protect their majorities next year. Yet some advisers believe that Trump should keep training his fire on Republicans, which would be better for his own independent brand. “Run against the elite leadership of both parties,” Stone said.\n\n“If we have a majority in both houses and we can’t cut taxes and we can’t repeal Obamacare, then shame on us,” Bennett said.\n\nThe bill for that shame could come due in November 2018.\n\nRead more from Paul Kane’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.","author":"Paul Kane, Paul Kane","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T15:00:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/25/National-Politics/Images/AFP_RT386.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"tOLx1bNX632vhr2TEu7M5g==\n"}

(Carolyn Kaster/ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIt’s a stock response of every White House press secretary who’s either caught off guard or is trying to dodge a sticky question. When a reporter asks a tough question during a briefing, the reply from the podium is often a punt: “I’ll get back to you on that.”\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, President Trump’s press secretary, invoked some version of IGBTYOT 10 times on Thursday , which may be a record for a single briefing, if records for such things were kept. Among other topics, she vowed to get back to reporters after they asked questions about: foreign aid to Egypt; the president’s ban on transgender members of the military; the arrest of a Russian dissident; the possibility of a presidential pardon for former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio; the job status of the Internal Revenue Service commissioner; and the White House’s reaction to federal approval of Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods Market.\n\nDon’t hold your breath waiting for her to follow up.\n\nWhite House reporters say it’s unusual for Sanders, or her predecessors, to make good on a promise to get back to them with an answer. They tend to regard the get-back-to-you line the way a creditor reacts to being told the check is in the mail: They’ll believe it when they see it.\n\nBloomberg News reporter Margaret Talev, for example, asked Sanders earlier this month about a report that the U.S. Air Force intended to purchase two Boeing 747s once used by a bankrupt Russian airline as a cheaper alternative to building a new Air Force One. “Can you verify the accuracy of the story?” Talev said. “Do you know if that’s correct?”\n\nSanders said she’d check and reply later. Talev never heard back.\n\nDuring the same briefing, CBS News reporter Chip Reid asked the press secretary if it would be “appropriate” for the president to apologize for telling police officers to be “rough” with suspects, a comment police officials and others had criticized. Sanders replied she would let him know if or when she knew.\n\nShe hasn’t, Reid said.\n\n“I don’t cover the White House on a regular basis so I wasn’t sure what to expect,” he said. “But as I was leaving the briefing room that day a few people who cover the White House full time told me not to expect her to get back to me. So I wasn’t surprised that she did not.”\n\nAt a briefing in mid-July, Fox News Radio reporter Jon Decker asked Sanders if the president viewed Russia as “a friend, a partner, an ally or an adversary?” Decker had asked a variation of the question two days earlier. Another reporter had asked a similar question the day after that. Neither had gotten an answer. On the third try, Sanders still didn’t have a response, but vowed, “I do assure you I will certainly work to make sure I get that answer to you.”\n\nMore than a month later, there hasn’t been an answer.\n\nJohn Gizzi of Newsmax got the I’ll-get-back-to-you treatment from Sanders in July when he asked her if Trump was willing to negotiate with Republicans in Congress about reforming Social Security and Medicare. Weeks later, Gizzi still hasn’t gotten an RSVP from Sanders. He blames himself, in part, for “not pursuing or pressing [her] harder.”\n\nOn the other hand, Gizzi did get a follow-up response from Sanders when he inquired about the U.S. delegation to former German chancellor Helmut Kohl’s funeral. Sanders delivered the details at a briefing in June. “I was impressed,” he said.\n\nGizzi rates Sanders as “above average” in following up on his questions, the same Lake Wobegone-ish mark he’d give “most” of the nine press secretaries he’s dealt with in covering the White House. “But none can be perfect and reply every time because there aren’t enough hours in the day,” he says.\n\nIn fact, given the many questions any White House faces, it’s unlikely a press secretary could have all the answers right at his or her fingertips. So the get-back-to-you formulation makes sense as a hedge against speaking prematurely or without a full command of the facts.\n\nBut reporters suspect it can also be a convenient way to avoid talking about an issue that might embarrass the president, particularly in front of a roomful of journalists and a bank of live TV cameras.\n\nAsked about her record of replying, Sanders said in an email she tries “to respond to as many questions as fully as I can at each briefing. I have also on several occasions followed up with reporters and answered their questions after the briefing when I can.”\n\nAsked in a subsequent email if she avoids inconvenient questions by declining to follow up, Sanders didn’t follow up with an answer.","author":"Paul Farhi, Paul Farhi","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T06:28:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/26/Style/Images/Trump_96330-a491f-2936.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"dxZ3yz6DdGh4OO1KgFfzbw==\n"}

Nicholson Jr., center, commander of Resolute Support forces and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, arrives during a transfer of authority ceremony April 29 at Shorab camp in Afghanistan’s Helmand province. (Reuters)\n\nFor months, Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., made the case for an expanded U.S. military commitment to Afghanistan, telling skeptics that the faltering Afghan war was an urgent matter of American security, that the struggling Afghan government was a reliable partner, and that its defense forces just needed more time and U.S. support to become self-sufficient.\n\nLast week, the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan finally got his wish.\n\nPresident Trump, who once advocated abandoning Afghanistan and in recent months questioned the fundamental premises of America’s costly 16-year military involvement here, has now publicly committed himself to a strategy that hews closely to the military plan Nicholson and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani hammered out in dozens of meetings this spring and summer.\n\nNow, the burden will be on Nicholson, 61, a boyish-looking four-star general who has spent more time in Afghanistan than any other senior commander, to deliver on what many observers say may be an impossible mission. Its aim is to help Afghan forces turn around a stalemated conflict with the aid of a few thousand extra advisory troops — something his predecessors failed to do with more than 100,000 combat troops at the war’s peak.\n\n[A ‘win’ in Afghanistan includes peace talks with the Taliban, say U.S. officials in Kabul]\n\nTrump and Nicholson do not know each other, and the general said last week that he communicates with administration officials through the military chain of command, meaning his boss at the U.S. Central Command in Tampa. At one White House meeting to discuss Afghan policy, Trump reportedly threatened to fire the popular Nicholson out of frustration at the stumbling war effort, stunning his aides.\n\nIn an interview at his headquarters here Friday, Nicholson declined to discuss that episode, and he referred to Trump’s speech on Afghanistan several times rather than answer questions directly. Asked if he now believes the president supports him, Nicholson paused, smiled and answered, “Yes.” Asked to elaborate, he smiled again and shook his head.\n\nIf he has any doubts about his mission here, the congenial but cautious West Pointer has buried them beneath a can-do persona and a glass-half-full approach to every problem. He exudes confidence in Ghani and his determination to reform the Afghan security forces, which have been weakened by corruption and nepotistic leadership. He heaps praise on the Afghan special operations forces, which will be doubled in size and trained by U.S. and NATO advisers under the new military plan.\n\nAnd he is relentlessly on message about connecting the dots among the ongoing fight against Afghan insurgents; the dangers of terrorism radiating from an unstable, Taliban-plagued Afghanistan; and the American interests at stake in making sure this impoverished Muslim nation does not again become a redoubt for international Islamist militias such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.\n\n“As a soldier, the concern I have is about terrorism emanating from this area,” Nicholson said in the interview, echoing Trump’s speech last Monday on Afghan strategy. “The requirement to keep pressure on these terror groups to prevent another attack on our homeland . . . fundamentally, that is why we are here.”\n\nAmericans, he added, “need to be concerned about the Islamic State emerging from this region. The Taliban enable them to exist, and if the Taliban were to return, they would flourish.” A return to Taliban rule, he said, “would mean another threat to our homeland.”\n\nThere is also another more personal aspect to Nicholson’s commitment: an evident empathy for Afghans and their struggles, developed through four tours of duty totaling five years of immersion in the conflict — from early optimistic days of sipping tea with tribal elders and inaugurating village projects to later struggles with military setbacks and growing Afghan resentment of the foreign military presence.\n\n[How Afghanistan is ramping up its fight against corruption — especially among the country’s elite]\n\n“I believe in the Afghan people,” he said. Since his first assignment here in 2006, he continued, “I came to have great respect and affection for the Afghan people, who have endured an incredible amount of hardship for the last four decades, yet still in spite of all that are incredibly pious, hard-working, hospitable and truly want a better life for their children.”\n\nThat attachment deepened during one of the worst crises of the U.S. combat mission, when an airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders hospital killed 42 people in 2015 during a chaotic battle with Taliban forces in the northern city of Kunduz. Several months later, when Nicholson assumed command of the U.S. reduced advisory mission, a U.S. military report came out acknowledging that a series of errors had led to the tragedy. Nicholson immediately apologized to the nation, then flew to Kunduz with his wife and met with families of the victims.\n\n“It was a very emotional and personal event,” he said. Afghans “don’t want to see a return of Taliban rule, and they genuinely appreciate our help. So when we make a mistake, it is the right thing to do to reach out to them.” The gesture also had a strategic aspect. “In this culture, when you make a mistake and make a genuine apology,” Nicholson said, it is “almost always accepted, and you are able to move on in the relationship. . . . That needs to happen in this long war.”\n\nLately, Nicholson said he has spent a lot of time consulting with Afghans of all political stripes and affiliations, seeking support and common cause at a time of domestic political turmoil and uncertainty about U.S. intentions, especially with the post of U.S. ambassador vacant since last winter. As a matter of course, he works with senior army, police and intelligence officials.\n\n[In Afghanistan, Trump’s speech brings relief to some. To others, ‘it means more war, destruction.’]\n\nBut the Afghan closest to Nicholson is Ghani, a no-nonsense technocrat who is often criticized by Afghans as autocratic and remote. The general, who meets with Ghani several times a week, called him a “very willing and capable partner” who is pursuing “rigorous reforms” across the government and the security sector, where corruption and poor leadership have been major impediments to the war effort.\n\nNicholson particularly praised Ghani for replacing a number of senior army and police officials with others who were more qualified and not tainted by corruption. He pointed to the removal of two army commanders in Kandahar and Helmand provinces, one of whom was recently convicted of keeping money for soldiers’ food and using combat troops as personal guards. Their replacements, he said, have “fundamentally changed the environment. . . we’re already seeing a difference on the battlefield.”\n\nThe general declined to discuss Pakistan’s role in the Afghan conflict, although for months he publicly argued in Congress and elsewhere that Pakistan was harboring Taliban fighters and that the U.S. government should pressure Pakistan to stop. In the interview, he was far more circumspect, referring vaguely to the problem of “external enablement” of insurgencies but stating that relations under the new U.S. strategy will be “managed from Washington to Islamabad.”\n\nNicholson was much more loquacious about the challenges on his own turf, with a ready list of achievements he hopes the expanded U.S. role in Afghanistan will produce. They include the defeat of al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, the reduction of foreign support to the insurgents, the increased capacity of the Afghan security forces, and the “marginalization” of the Taliban insurgents until they must either “die or reconcile.” Reconciliation will be complicated, he acknowledged, “but this conversation needs to begin.”\n\nRead more\n\nTrump announces new strategy for Afghanistan that calls for a troop increase\n\nSultry pop singer upstages Afghan Independence Day celebration\n\nAfghan president is under siege as violence, joblessness persist\n\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news","author":"Pamela Constable, Pamela Constable","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T17:42:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/23/Foreign/Images/2017-08-03T105439Z_62657345_RC14AFA9D610_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-AFGHANISTAN-4928.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"iJdP6E+NUzfAxDnjcCDVLQ==\n"}

John Delaney (D-Md.) and his wife, April McClain-Delaney, try corn dogs at the recent Iowa State Fair. Delaney is the first major Democrat to announce he will run for president in 2020. (William Widmer/For The Post)\n\nA growing number of Democratic lawmakers who are increasingly concerned that their party might fall short again in elections next year are on the road this summer to buck up beleaguered party activists and recruit new candidates.\n\nSome have broader political ambitions, but most of these little-known Democrats are being invited by local and state party activists seeking out fresh faces to help raise money, recruit candidates and woo new voters. It’s a reflection of the growing voter dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party’s top leaders in Washington — and sheer worry that the party may once again spoil its chances.\n\nStruggling to rebuild its ranks after being wiped out of power in Washington and some state capitals, Democrats run the risk of more setbacks next year, even as President Trump’s approval ratings tumble. The party is in dire straits, trailing national Republicans by some measures in fundraising. The Republican National Committee outraised its Democratic counterpart by more than $6 million in July.\n\nThese challenges come as an increasing number of new Democratic congressional candidates say that they won’t vote for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to lead their caucus in the future, signaling that they, like many of the voters they meet, want generational change as well as ideological change inside the caucus.\n\n[Analysis: The Democratic National Committee’s abysmal fundraising]\n\nRep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) looks at an elk in a livestock barn at the Iowa State Fair. She says she visited Iowa to get “more involved than ever before in our party.” (William Widmer/For The Post)\n\nAmong those traveling this summer is Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.), who supported Pelosi in last year’s leadership vote but at 41 is among the caucus’s younger members. She recently went far outside her district in Queens to visit the Iowa State Fair. Local Democrats picked her up at the airport, whisked her to the site of the famous butter cow and made sure she sampled such fair staples as a pork chop on a stick and fried Oreo cookies.\n\n“I might come back for breakfast,” she joked as she posed for photos with a pork chop, “the food here is so good.”\n\nMeng, who is a vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee, is focusing much of her political travel on rural areas in a bid to better understand how to win back voters who have drifted away from her party. She said she feels the need to reach out because, “We don’t have the numbers, honestly, in the House and the Senate, in the White House.”\n\nShe said she’s not in Iowa because she wants to run for president — but other House Democrats are already running or clearly thinking about it.\n\n“I’m not here to test waters,” she told a group of Des Moines-area Democrats as she explained why she was visiting the state for the first time. “I am here to do what so many people around this country are doing right now — being more involved than ever before in our party. I’m learning to be a better listener.”\n\nThe Democrats hitting the road this summer are different from the party leaders voters are accustom to seeing. One is Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), 54, who has announced he will quit Congress to run for president in 2020. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), 44, one of the most frequent travelers, is campaigning for Democrats in Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, Wisconsin, West Virginia, New Hampshire and Iowa, while declining to rule out a presidential bid. Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), 36, represents a San Francisco-area district, but he is an Iowa native and keeps visiting his birth state and wooing party activists.\n\n[Think things will be rosy for Democrats in 2018? Not so fast.]\n\nRep. Grace Meng, who represents a district in Queens, eats a deep-fried Oreo cookie at the Iowa State Fair. (William Widmer/For The Post)\n\nThe same Des Moines-area Democrats who hosted Meng are hosting Ryan and Reps. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), 55, and Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), 38, for a major party fundraiser next month. Moulton, who strongly supported Ryan’s bid to unseat Pelosi, has been the subject of recent reports about a fledgling presidential bid and is helping recruit fellow military veterans to run for office.\n\n“We’re seeing folks who aren’t an Obama, Biden, Clinton or a Sanders, and that’s what we as a party want to see,” said Sean Bagniewski, the party chairman in Polk County. He explained that Iowans are especially eager for Democrats to “focus on an economic agenda. As long as we have folks from the national party who are willing to come in and talk about that, we’re willing to host them.”\n\nPelosi last visited Iowa in 2016, and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) made recruiting trips to Iowa and New Hampshire ahead of last year’s congressional elections, aides said. But neither top party leader makes frequent stops in early primary states or traditionally Republican states, unless it’s to attend big-city, closed-door fundraisers.\n\nEver since challenging Pelosi, Ryan has been fielding invites from Democrats across the country who are eager to meet him, and he has eagerly obliged. While he’s taken a pass on running for governor of Ohio, he didn’t say no when asked if he is considering a presidential campaign. “I want to drive this national message,” he said. “Where it goes, it goes.”\n\nLucas Meyer, president of the New Hampshire Young Democrats, which hosted Ryan last week, said that members of his group appreciated that the Ohioan “is a young guy, he has a progressive message that people like and like to hear and isn’t afraid to ruffle feathers.”\n\nSwalwell is doing most of his travel on behalf of the Future Forum, a group of 27 younger House Democrats that he leads. The forum is recruiting 30- and 40-somethings to run for Congress next year. Swalwell has devoted a notable amount of time in recent weeks to Iowa, using his family roots in tiny Sac City as an excuse to visit.\n\nAfter making a stop to meet with a potential candidate in Omaha, he traveled across the river into Pottawattamie County, Iowa, where he headlined an event for local Democrats that local leaders said drew a bigger-than-expected crowd partly because activists were curious to meet a face they had seen frequently on CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.\n\nDuring the event, he announced plans to return for a similar Labor Day fundraiser. “People were like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’m going to tell my friends,’ ” said Linda Nelson, chairman of Pottawattamie County Democratic Party. “He’s helping us build a crowd.”\n\nGeri Frederiksen, a Democrat from Council Bluffs, credited Swalwell for taking the time to speak with a 24-year-old man who local Democrats had convinced to run for a school board seat.\n\n“Congressman Swalwell has told him he’d help him, he wants to know the outcome of the election,” Frederiksen said.\n\nSwalwell explained that he is merely “doing my part” to help rebuild the party. Democrats “just want to reclaim our country. We have seen where the president and Republican leadership in the House and Senate have taken us in the last seven months. No one on our side thinks that’s where we should be going.”\n\nDelaney, who flirted with running for governor of Maryland next year, has more personal motives for making trips to early primary states. Little known outside Maryland, he’s a self-made financier and one of the wealthiest members of Congress, with an estimated net worth of more than $90 million. He stunned some colleagues by announcing plans to run for the White House, and he says he plans to have offices and staff in Iowa and New Hampshire by the fall. He plans to instruct his campaign team to also work with Iowa and New Hampshire Democrats to make gains in next year’s midterm elections — a move that he thinks can help him dispel the notion that a little-known House lawmaker can’t win the presidency.\n\n[Rep. John Delaney is running for president in 2020]\n\n“The reason members of the House do not become president is because they don’t run for it,” he said. “It’s hard to become president if you don’t run for it.”\n\nOther Democrats thinking about running for president are only beginning to make overtures to party activists. According to several Democratic activists in the early primary states, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) is set to visit Iowa in September. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock has made overtures to Democrats in Iowa and South Carolina. Other names talked about as potential contenders, like Democratic Sens. Kamala D. Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Cory Booker of New Jersey, have so far declined invitations to headline fundraisers or give speeches, saying that they’re not yet ready to stir the pot.\n\nIn addition to Iowa, Meng has recently visited Louisiana and made a stop in Central New York to meet with Democratic activists from 14 counties where there are few elected Democrats.\n\nDuring her meeting with Democrats in Des Moines, one participant asked who she considers the leader of the party\n\n“I don’t have a good answer for you on that — is it Tom? Is it Chuck? Is it Nancy?” Meng said, referring to Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, Schumer and Pelosi. “I think we are hearing from a lot of newer members, younger surrogates of the party, and so no one can stand up and say, ‘Here I am, the appointed voice of our party.’ ”\n\nA woman asked, “Do you think our country will survive the next four years of Donald Trump?”\n\n“Yes, I think we’ll survive, but I think we have to work hard,” Meng said. “There are no shortcuts anymore. We have to really lay the groundwork and get back to the basics. It’s going to be really, really hard. At the end, our country will be stronger.”\n\nRead more at PowerPost","author":"Ed O'Keefe, Ed O'Keefe","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-25T07:41:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/25/Others/Images/2017-08-17/Widmer_IOWA-49.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"noKfoR+qT7qVpe/Xg85uCQ==\n"}

(Denver7 News)\n\nSchool officials in Denver have fired a cheerleading coach amid controversy over disturbing videos of teenage girls wailing in pain while apparently being forced to perform leg splits.\n\nDenver Public Schools Superintendent Tom Boasberg announced Friday that newly hired coach Ozell Williams has been fired from his job at East High School. Williams is a Guinness World Record holder and former contestant on the NBC reality series “America’s Got Talent.”\n\nThe allegations involve at least eight girls, according to Denver’s NBC affiliate, KUSA. In one clip obtained by the station, a 13-year-old incoming freshman shrieks “please stop” nine times during a span of 24 seconds. The technique, known as “forced splits,” happened at a cheer camp last June and was captured in videos that were later provided to school officials.\n\n“I have watched all of the videos. And as a superintendent, and as a father, and as an athlete, they are deeply disturbing,” Boasberg said in a statement. “What happened was wrong. Under no circumstances should a young person be in a situation where they are suffering physical or emotional harm. Under no circumstances should a young person be forced to continue any activity beyond the point where they have expressed their desire to stop.”\n\n[Disturbing video shows high school cheerleaders screaming as they’re forced to do splits]\n\nBoasberg said officials at the high school found out about the videos in June, when the mother of one of the teenage girls raised concerns, but did not fire Williams.\n\n“It is also clear that the decision at that time not to terminate the employment of cheer coach Mr. Ozell Williams was wrong,” Boasberg said. “What is shown in the videos is extraordinarily distressing.”\n\nBoasberg said neither he nor any member of his senior team knew of the existence of the videos until earlier this week, when the school district received a public records request from the media. Five high school officials, including Williams, were later placed on administrative leave. A child-abuse investigation by Denver Police is ongoing.\n\nA call to Williams’s business, Mile High Tumblers, was not returned Saturday, but he told KUSA that he learned the split technique while in Chicago and New Orleans. He has been a regular halftime performer at Denver Broncos football games, and set the world record for consecutive handsprings — 57 — in 2013. His stint on “America’s Got Talent” came in 2015.\n\nOn his website, Williams offers some insight into his training philosophy. “Our mission,” it says, “is to develop strong athletes and well-rounded citizens by teaching discipline, responsibility, respect, sense of ownership and other characteristics that mimic upstanding citizenship.”\n\n[A teacher asked kids ‘how comfortable’ they are around black men, Muslims. She was fired.]\n\nKirsten Wakefield, whose 13-year-old daughter Ally is seen screaming in one of the videos, emailed the school district June 15 demanding to know what the administration would do about her daughter’s injury. KUSA reported an investigation began only after the news station made inquiries.\n\n“This is a grown man,” Kirsten Wakefield told KUSA, “pushing my 13-year-old against her will.”\n\nAnother parent, Cheri Nickolay, said watching the videos made her ill. Her daughter has quit the cheerleading squad, she said, adding, “I don’t know how you could justify that.”\n\nBoasberg said the district has hired a law firm to investigate which high school and district employees knew of the forced split technique — and when they knew about it.\n\n“I want to say this as clearly as I can,” he said. “We were wrong not to have taken certain actions in June and we are doing everything in our power to ensure the safety and well-being of every one of our students.”\n\nIn addition to Williams and his assistant coach, Mariah Cladis, Principal Andy Mendelsberg and Assistant Principal Lisa Porter were put on leave, as was an attorney employed by the school district, Michael Hickman.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nThese California teachers mocked students for skipping school on immigrant boycott day\n\n‘Negligent’ school let bleach end up in a special-needs student’s feeding tube, lawsuit claims\n\nStudent’s leg amputated after contractor body-slammed him, lawyer says; police investigating","author":"Kristine Phillips, Andrew deGrandpre, Kristine Phillips, Andrew deGrandpre","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T09:11:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/files/2017/08/cheer2.png\u0026w=1484\u0026op=resize\u0026opt=1\u0026filter=antialias\u0026t=20170517","digest":"TtT12h6sbV+rNKypYOKHRA==\n"}

(Creighton/LNP/REX/Shutterstock/AP)\n\nJabed Hussain said he was really lucky. The delivery driver was one of the latest victims in an alarming surge of acid attacks in Britain.\n\nHe was still trembling when he said, “But they didn’t get my face. They didn’t ruin me.”\n\nAttacks by people throwing acid at their victims has tripled in the past three years in Britain, stoking fears that almost anyone can be the victim — from a moped rider to the city banker or politician.\n\nThe alarming rise comes amid a clampdown on weapons and fears of a frightening new crime fad involving teenage motorbike thieves using corrosive substances, in part because they are relatively easy to obtain.\n\nHussain, 30, was riding his three-wheel scooter, stopped at a traffic light in East London earlier this month, when he felt what he thought was water, doused on him by a pair of faceless teenagers in wraparound helmets, mounted on a motorbike beside him.\n\n“Then I started to feel the burning, and I knew instantly what it was,” Hussain said. “Because this is what we are all fearing.”\n\nHe ripped off his helmet and began clawing at his clothing. His assailants stole his bike and sped away, as Hussain begged passing motorists for help.\n\n“I must have looked like a mad man,” Hussain said. “Nobody would roll down their windows for me.”\n\n[After attack near mosques, British Muslims fear they may be targeted]\n\nThe United Kingdom is a safe country, but the spike in acid attacks is clearly unnerving — when a possible assailant is anyone with a bottle of bleach, ammonia or drain cleaner.\n\n“Because it is not like seeing a gun or a knife,” said Rachel Kearton, Assistant Chief Constable of the Suffolk Police, the National Police Chief Council’s top investigator on corrosive attacks.\n\n“Because the intent is to maim and disfigure,” Kearton said.\n\nAccording to the London Metropolitan Police and regional police chiefs, there were more than 700 acid attacks last year, double the number in 2015.\n\nKearton told The Washington Post it appears likely acid attack numbers will increase by another 50 percent this year.\n\nPolice chiefs say there isn’t a single motive behind the attacks, but acknowledge gangs and robberies seem to be playing a part. Some of the attackers are only teenagers — of those whose ages are known, 21 percent under the age of 18. The most common corrosive liquids are bleach, ammonia and acid.\n\nAccording to leaders in London’s City Hall, “many recent acid attacks are connected to violent and aggressive organized scooter theft.” In a recent statement, they said “this is particularly frightening for people who ride scooters in London.”\n\nScooter drivers have staged a number of protests to highlight their concerns about being doused with acid in attempted bike robberies.\n\nPolice, victims and the gang members agree — there is just something terrifying about being splashed with acid.\n\n[After an attacker targeted Muslims in London’s Finsbury Park, a local imam may have saved his life]\n\nLate last year, a London business executive named Gina Miller took the British government to court to decide if it could trigger Brexit, Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, without parliamentary approval.\n\nSince then, Miller said she’s been living in fear someone will attack her.\n\n“I have been getting threats of having acid thrown in my face for months and months now. When I see someone walk toward me on the street with a bottle of water or something, I just freak out,” she told Verdict magazine.\n\n“My life has completely changed,” she said.\n\nOhid Ahmed, a councilor from Jabed Hussain’s East London neighborhood, said while acid was certainly the latest weapon of choice for assailants, there was something deeper going on.\n\n“If you want to steal a moped, you can steal a moped,” he said. The criminal can use a hammer, a knife or his fists, he said. “But throwing acid is a hate crime,” Ahmed said.\n\nYou are seeking to destroy your victim, he said.\n\nSome places are taking extra precautions. Earlier this month, officials in some court buildings began asking anyone entering a court with a water bottle — visitors, judges, lawyers — to take a “ sip test” to prove their liquid isn’t acid.\n\nBritain is “near the top, or the top of the pack globally,” when it comes to reported attacks, said Jaf Shah, executive director of Acid Survivors Trust International, a London-based nonprofit. He said other countries, including India, likely have far more attacks, but they remain unreported.\n\nThe U.K. is unusual in that so many of the attacks are against men. In many other countries, women and girls are disproportionately impacted with spurned men or jilted suitors dousing former wives or girlfriends in the hope of disfiguring them for life.\n\nBy contrast, Shah said, two-thirds of the victims in the U.K. are men. Campaigners say the rise in attacks could be linked to a clampdown on weapons.\n\nIn 2015, a “two strikes” rule was introduced so those convicted of carrying a knife for the second time received a mandatory six-month prison sentence.\n\nShah said for some gang members it’s possible acid is becoming “the weapon of choice” because it’s now seen as a “safe crime to commit because you can’t be charged for carrying acid, only charged if police can prove intent.”\n\nTo be sure, the number of acid attacks in the U.K. is dwarfed by gun and knife crime statistics.\n\n[After attack on London Muslims by a ‘clean-shaven white man,’ British newspapers are accused of double standard]\n\nBut the increase is still alarming, and the British government is reviewing its guidelines to see if police and prosecutors have the powers they need and if new restrictions will be placed on retailers who sell corrosive liquids.\n\n“We have seen acid used in cases of gang violence, drug trafficking, domestic abuse and so-called honour-based violence,” the Home Secretary Amber Rudd wrote in the Sunday Times. “We can and will improve our response,” she wrote.\n\nStephen Timms, a lawmaker for the opposition Labour Party, has called on the government to introduce harsher punishment for the possession of corrosive liquids.\n\n“It should be a criminal offense to carry acid around on the streets in the same way that it is already in the U.K. a criminal offense to carry a knife,” he said.\n\nIn Britain, it is illegal to carry a knife without a good reason.\n\nTimms’s constituency in east London has some of the highest levels of acid attacks in the country. An attack in June on two Muslim cousins sparked panic in the local community, he said. Jameel Muhktar and Resham Khan were celebrating Khan’s 21st birthday in east London on the day their worlds turned upside down. They were stopped at traffic lights when a man knocked on their car window and hurled acid at them.\n\nAfter that attack, Timms said, “people starting asking themselves, especially women, was it safe to walk down the street without someone throwing acid over you?”\n\nWriting from her hospital bed, Khan has won many admirers on social media for chronicling the highs and lows of her recovery.\n\n“My plans are in pieces; my pain is unbearable, and I write this letter in hospital whilst I patiently wait for the return of my face,” she wrote in one blog entry calling on lawmakers and retailers to make a number of changes.\n\n“I can’t dwell on the past but what I can do is help build a better future, one without attacks like these,” she said.\n\nRead more\n\nThe last British lynx was killed 1,300 years ago.

Soon after, the White House would make a series of controversial announcements. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAs a monster hurricane not seen on American shores in over a decade bore down on Texas on Friday night, a tsunami of news out of Washington was also on its way.\n\nPresident Trump, in the space of four hours, made official a ban on transgender people serving in the military, pardoned a controversial sheriff accused of racial profiling and parted ways with polarizing aide and conservative media darling Sebastian Gorka.\n\nThe announcements were made in the evening hours as the nation focused on Hurricane Harvey, which threatened catastrophic damage to areas along the Gulf Coast, giving new meaning to the Friday night news dump strategy that has long been a staple for Washington politicians looking to bury controversial decisions.\n\n“It was very risky, because if the hurricane is as bad as the experts were predicting, then he’s opening himself up to a lot of potential criticism,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist and former aide to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). “But very little that Trump does surprises me any longer. He’s proven to be very unpredictable and to not act within the norms of other politicians.”\n\nLike most aspects of Trump’s presidency, the perceived news dump enraged his detractors and buoyed his most ardent supporters, while leaving open the question of how it will be received by voters who don’t fit neatly into either camp.\n\nPresident Trump pardoned former Maricopa County, Ariz., sheriff Joe Arpaio Aug. 25. Here’s what you need to know. (Patrick Martin/The Washington Post)\n\nSome Republicans said the timing of the announcements reflected the current state of the White House — new Chief of Staff John F. Kelly trying to instill more order even as the president remains the most disruptive force.\n\nOne Republican close to the White House said Kelly appeared to be trying to quietly clean up Trump’s policy move on transgender troops, which had been left in limbo for weeks after the president announced his decision on Twitter to the surprise of the military and with no formal plan ready to be released. While the policy was formally released Friday, it did not provide certainty on the most pressing question: the fate of transgender people currently serving. The presidential memorandum left it to the Pentagon to commission a report on how to deal with the service members’ fate, keeping open the possibility they may be permitted to remain on active duty.\n\nGorka’s ouster had been expected for weeks following Kelly’s hiring, especially after the departure of his ally, former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, despite Trump’s fondness for Gorka’s willingness to go on television and criticize the media. Gorka’s credentials as a counterterrorism expert have long been in question, and he was criticized inside and outside the White House for having no concrete responsibilities beyond serving as a surrogate for Trump on the airwaves. But the move was still expected to draw criticism from Trump’s allies, who view it as the death knell for the populist wing in the White House, making the leak of the news late Friday advantageous for the administration.\n\nKelly was probably aware there was little he could do to stop Trump from pardoning Arpaio despite — and perhaps because of — the likely backlash.\n\n“Kelly is really strong right now,” said the Republican close to the White House. “He gives his best advice, but he wasn’t going to stop the Sheriff Joe thing. Everything else was textbook what a really good chief of staff would do: dump a whole bunch of stuff when there’s a hurricane coming.”\n\nDemocrats and activist groups saw a cynical motive and play, and accused Trump of using a natural disaster as cover for unpalatable moves that were aimed mostly at rousing his base and that sent clear messages to the LGBT community and Hispanic Americans that he condoned discrimination.\n\n“As millions of people in TX and LA are prepping for the hurricane, the President is using the cover of the storm to pardon a man who violated a court’s order to stop discriminating against Latinos and ban courageous transgender men and women from serving our nation’s Armed Forces,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) posted on Twitter. “So sad, so weak.”\n\nThe Arpaio pardon, which Trump foreshadowed at a raucous rally in Phoenix days earlier, was aimed squarely at satisfying his base by rewarding a political loyalist on an issue, illegal immigration, that was central to Trump’s political appeal.\n\n“The President brought justice to a situation where the Obama administration had attempted to destroy a political opponent,” said Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.). “Sheriff Joe Arpaio made many enemies in the judicial system, the media and the left because he enforced laws that the federal government ignored. He did right by the law even as the political consequences continued to mount.”\n\nBut among legal experts, the pardon raised disturbing questions about Trump’s willingness to flout long-standing tradition and Department of Justice procedures in a way that undermined the judicial system, said University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias.\n\n“Certainly the pardon seemed principally political and without much thought about the history of that or the procedures used,” Tobias said. “It’s a bigger piece of Trump’s contempt for the judiciary. Every federal judge in the country knows you can’t have those orders violated, otherwise the federal court system won’t work. So that’s very disturbing.”\n\nThe White House’s balancing act was evident in the president’s own social media feed. Hours after the Arpaio pardon was announced, Trump tweeted confirmation that the federal government had approved a disaster declaration for Texas. Fifteen minutes later, he congratulated Arpaio.\n\n“I am pleased to inform you that I have just granted a full Pardon to 85 year old American patriot Sheriff Joe Arpaio,” Trump said. “He kept Arizona safe!”\n\nSome Republicans, including Arizona’s two Republican senators, who have both recently been in Trump’s crosshairs, questioned the decision to circumvent the judicial process. Arpaio was scheduled to be sentenced in October after being convicted of defying a court order to end the practice of detaining people merely on suspicion of their immigration status.\n\nSen. John McCain decried the message Trump sent by pardoning Arpaio, who had been accused of continuing to “illegally profile Latinos living in Arizona based on their perceived immigration status.”\n\n“The President has the authority to make this pardon, but doing so at this time undermines his claim for the respect of rule of law as Mr. Arpaio has shown no remorse for his actions,” McCain added.\n\nAs Trump’s approval ratings have fallen to historic lows, however, most analysts expect him to continue making moves that will please his base even if they draw criticism from others.\n\n“The president has great political instincts. He can read the temperature of the public better than almost anyone else,” Conant said. “He is very well aware that his base is shrinking, and in a way, that explains almost everything he’s done over the last month.”","author":"Abby Phillip, Abby Phillip","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T10:39:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/26/National-Politics/Images/AFP_RU6FT.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"RN9YARC+PTX3AiE1Q0Vyrg==\n"}

His participation in a study of MDMA, the drug commonly known as ecstasy, proved life-saving. (Travis Dove/For The Washington Post)\n\nFor Jon Lubecky, the scars on his wrists are a reminder of the years he spent in mental purgatory.\n\nHe returned from an Army deployment in Iraq a broken man. He heard mortar shells and helicopters where there were none. He couldn’t sleep and drank until he passed out. He got every treatment offered by Veterans Affairs for post-traumatic stress disorder. But they didn’t stop him from trying to kill himself — five times.\n\nFinally, he signed up for an experimental therapy and was given a little green capsule. The anguish stopped.\n\nInside that pill was a compound named MDMA, better known by dealers and rave partygoers as ecstasy. That street drug is emerging as the most promising tool to come along in years for the military’s escalating PTSD epidemic.\n\nThe MDMA program was created by a small group of psychedelic researchers who had toiled for years in the face of ridicule, funding shortages and skepticism. But the results have been so positive that this month the Food and Drug Administration deemed it a “breakthrough therapy” — setting it on a fast track for review and potential approval.\n\nA dose of MDMA in the office of South Carolina psychiatrist Michael Mithoefer, who has studied its use as a treatment for PTSD. (Travis Dove/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe prospect of a government-sanctioned psychedelic drug has generated both excitement and concern. And it has opened the door to scientists studying new uses for other illegal psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin (commonly known as magic mushrooms).\n\n“We’re in this odd situation where one of the most promising therapies also happens to be a Schedule 1 substance banned by the [Drug Enforcement Administration],” said retired Brig. Gen. Loree Sutton, who until 2010 was the highest ranking psychiatrist in the U.S. Army.\n\nBecause of the stigma attached to psychedelics since the trippy 1960s, many military and government leaders still hesitate to embrace them. Some scientists are also wary of the nonprofit spearheading ecstasy therapy, a group with the stated goal of making the banned drugs part of mainstream culture.\n\nBut the scope and severity of PTSD makes it all irrelevant, said Sutton, who now works as New York City’s commissioner of veteran services. “If this is something that could really save lives, we need to run and not walk toward it. We need to follow the data.”\n\nPTSD has been a problem for the military for decades, but America’s recent wars have pushed it to epidemic-level heights. Experts estimate between 11 and 20 percent of soldiers who served in Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from PTSD.\n\nThe affliction is typically triggered after experiencing or witnessing violence, including assault and abuse. It has ravaged lives and broken up marriages. It often leaves its victims in sudden panic and prevents them from dealing with the original trauma.\n\nAnd that last symptom is what makes PTSD particularly hard to overcome with traditional talk therapy. Because patients can’t talk about and process the trauma, experts say, it lingers like a poison in their mind.\n\nRick Doblin founded a nonprofit advocating research into the therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs. (Nirvan Mullick)\n\nOnly two drugs are approved for treating PTSD: Zoloft and Paxil. Both have proved largely ineffective when it comes to veterans, whose cases are especially difficult to resolve because of their prolonged or repeated exposure to combat.\n\n“If you’re a combat veteran with multiple tours of duty, the chance of a good response to these drugs is one in three, maybe lower,” said John Krystal, chairman of psychiatry at Yale University and a director at the VA’s National Center for PTSD. “That’s why there’s so much frustration and interest in finding something that works better.”\n\n*****\n\nEcstasy has long been a favorite at trance parties and raves because of its unique ability to flood users with intense feelings of euphoria. But as a byproduct, it also reduces fear and imbues users with a deep sense of love and acceptance of themselves and others — the perfect conditions for trauma therapy.\n\nBy giving doses of MDMA at the beginning of three, eight-hour therapy sessions, researchers say they have helped chronic PTSD patients process and move past their traumas.\n\nIn clinical trials with 107 patients closely monitored by the FDA, 61 percent reported major reductions in symptoms — to the point where they no longer fit the criteria for PTSD. Follow-up studies a year later found 67 percent no longer had PTSD.\n\n“If you were to design the perfect drug to treat PTSD, MDMA would be it,” said Rick Doblin, who three decades ago founded the California nonprofit behind the clinical trials.\n\nIt is no accident that the group — the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) — chose PTSD as its argument for ending the government’s ban on psychedelics.\n\n“We wanted to help a population that would automatically win public sympathy,” he said. “No one’s going to argue against the need to help them.”\n\nDoblin, now 63, talks openly about his own history with drugs. He began tripping on LSD as a rebellious, long-haired college freshman in the 1970s. He says it helped him see the world and himself in new ways. He wanted to become a therapist and use psychedelics to help others achieve similar insights, but he couldn’t because LSD was already banned.\n\n“The flaw of the early psychedelic movement was that they made it countercultural, a revolution,” he said. “Culture is dominant. Culture is always going to win.”\n\nFor a decade, he worked in construction until he came across MDMA for the first time. When the DEA moved to criminalize it in 1984, Doblin created MAPS and sued the agency. The lawsuit failed, and Doblin realized that psychedelics were perceived as too fringe to win public support.\n\nTo succeed, he decided, both he and the issue had to go mainstream.\n\nDoblin talked his way into the public policy PhD program at Harvard University and learned to navigate the federal bureaucracy. He shaved off his mustache, cut his shaggy hair and learned to dress up.\n\n“I used to laugh about how simple it was,” he said. “You put on a suit, and suddenly everyone thinks you’re fine.”\n\nThe external switch reflected an internal one as well. Instead of fighting government officials, he began plotting to win them over, especially those at the FDA.\n\nAnd the key, he realized, was science.\n\n****\n\nBefore the FDA would even talk about clinical trials for MDMA, the agency needed proof it wasn’t dangerous. Previous studies suggesting its neurotoxicity had been limited to rats. So in 1986, Doblin scraped together money to buy monkeys for those same researchers, who found the risks to be much less at human-equivalent doses than previously thought.\n\nThe next step was investigating MDMA’s effects on people. Doblin again raised money to fly psychedelic users he had befriended to Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University for spinal taps. The studies were approved by review boards at both institutions. Doblin also participated, undergoing two spinal taps.\n\nIn the two decades that followed, Doblin and MAPS inched toward progress.\n\nThe nonprofit grew from a one-man band to a staff of 25 with headquarters in Santa Cruz. It tapped into the scene in Silicon Valley — where many tech entrepreneurs have used psychedelics to spark creativity. (Steve Jobs famously praised LSD as “one of the two or three most important things I have done in my life.”)\n\nMAPS received a $5.5 million bequest from the founder of a software company. The hipster soap company Dr. Bronner’s pledged $5 million. A professional poker player who attributed his wins to microdosing on LSD gave $25,000. Recently, an anonymous $21,000 bitcoin donation came in.\n\nMuch of that money funded small-scale clinical trials, which laid the groundwork for the last remaining hurdle: Large-scale “phase 3” trials that will begin next year, involving 200 to 300 patients in 14 locations.\n\nIf those future trials yield similar results, the FDA could approve the MDMA treatment for PTSD as soon as 2021, according to Doblin.\n\nYet his dream extends beyond that. He envisions a future where psychedelic treatment centers are in every city — places people can visit for enhanced couples therapy, spiritual experiences and personal growth. He believes psychedelics can help address the country’s biggest problems, from homelessness and war to global warming.\n\n“These drugs are a tool that can make people more compassionate, tolerant, more connected with other humans and the planet itself,” he said.\n\nThat kind of talk makes many in the medical community nervous.\n\nIt’s hard to measure the exact dangers of ecstasy. Because it is not used as widely as marijuana or cocaine, for example, fewer statistics are available on overdoses or injuries. In 2011, a public health monitoring system identified 22,498 emergency department visits nationwide related to ecstasy.\n\nMDMA researchers point out that one key difference between MDMA and street ecstasy (along with another variant called “molly”) is the street versions often contain other harmful drugs, experts say. Sometimes the pills don’t even contain MDMA.\n\nBut even in its purest clinical form, MDMA can pose risks. At high doses, it can cause the body to overheat. It can cause anxiety and increase the stress hormone cortisol. Chronic use can also cause memory impairment.\n\n“I think it’s a dangerous substance,” said Andrew Parrott, a psychology professor at Swansea University in Wales who spent years researching the drug’s harmful effects. He worries FDA approval for the treatment of PTSD could lead many in the public to believe ecstasy is safe for recreational use.\n\nOther experts, however, have become increasingly intrigued by its promising results.\n\n“Anytime you have an organization that is advocating for drugs that are illegal, it marginalizes them in the research field. MAPS still isn’t seen as mainstream. But it’s possible they have a point here,” said Krystal, the Yale psychiatrist, who has not been involved with the group’s research. “I can’t think of a single medication that doesn’t carry some side effect. The question here is whether the benefits outweigh the risk.”\n\n*****\n\nFor Lubecky, the drug can’t be approved fast enough.\n\nThe Marine Corps and Army veteran recalls coming home from Iraq in 2006 to discover his wife had left him, sold his motorcycle and taken his dog. That, coupled with the trauma of what he had saw at war, sent him over the edge.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, he put the muzzle of his Beretta to his temple and pulled the trigger. The gun malfunctioned, he said, “but that microsecond after the hammer fell is when I finally felt at peace because I knew the pain would finally be over.”\n\nOne incident in Iraq in particular tormented him — a shot he took while protecting his unit. “It was a situation where the right thing to do was the immoral thing,” he said, declining to describe it in detail. “You’re looking through a scope at another human being and you do one thing and suddenly they don’t exist anymore.”\n\nFor years he told no one about it. He would panic even thinking about it.\n\nAfter he was accepted into the MDMA clinical trial in South Carolina, he found himself on a futon with two counselors on either side as the effects of drug sunk in.\n\n“I was in such a comfortable place,” recalled Lubecky, 40, who now works in Charleston as a political consultant. “I didn’t even realize I was finally talking about it, admitting it for the first time to anybody.”\n\nSince then, he said, he has learned to accept what happened in Iraq. And the guilt he now struggles with is the fact he got chosen over others for the clinical trial.\n\n“I was the 26th veteran chosen for a 26-person study,” he said. “I have friends who are suffering every day like I was. But they can’t do it because it’s illegal. This could save their lives.”\n\nRead more:\n\nOnetime party drug hailed as miracle for treating severe depression\n\nKey ingredient in ‘magic mushrooms’ eased cancer patients’ fear of death","author":"William Wan, William Wan","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T11:04:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/26/Others/Images/2017-08-25/20170824PTSDstudyWaPoE0009.JPG?t=20170517","digest":"FF6B+dO1q+PwNqRPmRhU/g==\n"}

One death has been attributed to the storm, which has also halted about one quarter of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico and 5 percent of U.S. refining capacity. Its second act could be worse as Harvey stalls and promises to dump feet of rain onto Texas for the next few days.\n\n“This is catastrophic,” said Greg Waller, a service coordination hydrologist with the National Weather Service’s West Gulf River Forecast Center in Fort Worth, Texas. “When we say record setting it means you cannot use history on your side because the rivers have never been this high before.”\n\nDamage from the initial strike won’t tell the whole story, said Chuck Watson, director of research and development, at Enki Holdings LLC in Savannah, Georgia. “If it was a traditional hurricane it would be a $2 billion storm, maybe $3 billion, but that is not what this storm is about,” Watson said.\n\nStalled Storm\n\nHarvey was the strongest storm to hit the U.S. since 2004. After making landfall, it has been downgraded to a tropical storm and come to a near-standstill near the town of Victoria, Texas.\n\nHarvey is flooding a region that has a cluster of refineries that process 5 million barrels of oil a day. About 1 million barrels a day of crude and condensate refining capacity in Texas have been shut by companies including Valero Energy Corp., according to company statements, government releases and people familiar with the situation. Its path through the Gulf shuttered 24 percent of oil production, along with the port of Corpus Christi, which ships the largest amount of U.S. crude overseas.\n\nIn addition to the energy threat, crops and livestock may struggle to cope with rising waters, while airlines have canceled flights at multiple Texas airports. At least 1,058 inbound and outbound flights were canceled Saturday from Texas airports in Houston, Dallas, Corpus Christi, Austin and San Antonio, according FlightAware, a Houston-based airline tracking company. Another 899 were scrubbed for Sunday.\n\nFor more information on hurricanes, click here\n\nAt least 252,247 customers were without power across the state, according to a Bloomberg survey of electric utility outage maps. The drop in electricity demand could depress natural gas prices.\n\nHarvey’s position is allowing it to pull moisture-laden air off the Gulf, called a feeder band, which will help keep it alive and promises more moisture for Houston, said Dan Pydynowski, a meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania.\n\n“That feeder band is going to remain in the general vicinity of Houston perhaps through Monday or even beyond,” Pydynowski said. “This is going to flood areas the don’t typically flood. It is going to have a tremendous impact on businesses, homes, property and the ability to travel in the entire Houston area.”\n\nFrom 15 to 30 inches of rain is forecast across the entire region, with some areas getting as much as 40 inches.\n\nHarvey sent thousands of residents along the coast fleeing and caused Governor Greg Abbott to declare an emergency.

F.S.H. stimulates the production of eggs in women and sperm in men.\n\nResearchers knew that blood levels of F.S.H. soar as women’s ovaries start to fail before menopause. At the same time, women rapidly lose bone — even when blood levels of estrogen, which can preserve bone, remain steady.\n\nDr. Zaidi reasoned that F.S.H. could be a culprit in bone loss. So he and his colleagues created an antibody that blocked F.S.H. in female mice whose ovaries had been removed.\n\nSince the mice were making no estrogen at all, they ought to have been losing bone. Indeed, the bone marrow in such mice usually fills with fat instead of developing bone cells. Much the same happens in women: That’s why their bones become less dense.\n\nBut in Dr. Zaidi’s lab, the mice that received the antibody did not develop fat-filled bone marrow — and, to his enormous surprise, they lost large amounts of fat.\n\n“This is a weird, weird finding,” he recalled telling his friend Dr. Clifford J. Rosen, a bone specialist at Maine Medical Center Research Institute. Dr. Zaidi persuaded Dr. Rosen to help repeat the experiments independently, each in his own lab.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt first, Dr. Rosen was dubious: “I said, ‘I don’t believe it, I think it’s not going to work, and it will cost a lot of money.’” But he received a grant for the research, and the two labs got started.\n\nTwo and a half years later, they had their results — and they replicated Dr. Zaidi’s original findings. The researchers also came up with a theory that might explain increased metabolic rates in mice in which F.S.H. is blocked.\n\nThere are two kinds of fat in the body: White fat primarily stores energy, and brown fat burns calories and throws off heat.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBrown fat is more common in children, but researchers have found that adults also carry small amounts. In the experimental mice, white fat was being converted to brown fat.\n\nAt the moment, Dr. Rosen is withholding judgment about whether the results will apply to humans. “I think the idea has some credibility,” he said. “But does it mean anything? I don’t know.”\n\nBut these are not the only researchers to find a link between obesity and the strange interplay of hormones.\n\nWendy Kohrt, a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado, has been studying the effects of menopause on women’s body fat and the amount of calories women burn.\n\nDr. Kohrt has given healthy premenopausal women a drug that blocks production of estrogen and F.S.H., putting them into a reversible state of menopause.\n\nWithin five months, she found, the women’s fat moves to their abdomens, increasing by 11 percent on average. And they burn 50 fewer calories per day.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe effect is reversed when the participants stop taking the drug or when Dr. Kohrt gives them estrogen.\n\nSomething similar goes on in men, although it’s not clear that F.S.H. is the sole cause, said Dr. Michael W. Schwartz, director of the Nutrition Obesity Research Center at the University of Washington.\n\nMen with advanced prostate cancer often take Lupron, a drug intended to stop the production of testosterone, which can fuel their tumors. Often, they gain weight, accumulating fat in their abdomens.\n\nLupron also blocks production of F.S.H., and the mouse studies suggest that this should prevent weight gain. That might be because of the loss of testosterone.\n\nYet in experiments in which men were given both Lupron and testosterone — leaving F.S.H. the only blocked hormone — they still did not lose weight. F.S.H. clearly is not the only factor at work, then.\n\nBut the dream of an easy way to prevent abdominal weight gain is so appealing, you just want it to be true, said Dr. Philipp E. Scherer, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nHe has seen too many mouse studies fail in humans to be persuaded that this one will succeed. “I will be on the sidelines waiting,” he said.\n\nDr. Zaidi is undeterred. He is already preparing to test an anti-F.S.H. antibody in people.\n\n“Whether it works in humans, I have absolutely no idea,” Dr. Zaidi said.","author":"Gina Kolata","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-22T19:54:20.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png","digest":"ZKU8gHyMPtGP8A25AKU/jQ==\n"}

In truth, he did seem to run out of gas quickly, forcing him to spend much of rounds four and five on the ropes, bobbing and weaving to desperately avoid trouble.\n\nBut he was in deep water, Jack had looked relaxed all week and he did here as he picked his rival's defence apart. The left hand proved a go-to weapon. Cleverly's pawed jabs were countered with ease, he was simply proving too easy to hit. Four big left hands landed in the fourth, prompting howls from those ringside.\n\nJack, who gave up his WBC title to move up a division, has a fine record against British fighters, having drawn with IBF super-middleweight champion James DeGale and beaten WBA king George Groves.\n\nHe is a tough man and hyped out of Las Vegas' Mayweather Boxing Gym, with just one defeat in 25 career fights. Beating him would have proven Cleverly's finest hour by his own admission but he never threatened to defend the title he took from Juergen Braehmer in October.\n\nA two-time world champion at the weight, Cleverly will now have to take stock after the fourth loss of his 34-fight career. He has returned to world level from tough defeats to Tony Bellew and Sergey Kovalev in the past but now again finds himself with questions to answer.","author":"BBC Sport","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-27T03:14:07.000Z"},"source":"bbc-sport","urlToImage":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/10370/production/_97561466_cleverly_reuters1.jpg","digest":"PJWSqKqpDRwFmbwSzIchwA==\n"}

One hint of trouble ahead: Half its shoppers subscribe to Amazon Prime.","title":"Costco Is Playing a Dangerous Game With the Web","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-24/costco-is-playing-a-dangerous-game-with-the-web","text":"Costco Wholesale Corp. first went online in November 1998, the same year a dot-com upstart called Amazon.com Inc. branched out from books to music and DVDs. Retail giants Target Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. had yet to make their initial forays onto the web.\n\nSince then, Amazon has surged ahead to dominate e-commerce, and Wal-Mart and Target have invested billions to develop their own digital chops. Meanwhile, online bulk-shopping upstart Boxed.com is mimicking Costco’s warehouse approach—only without the stores. But during all those years, Costco.com just plodded along, growing no faster than the broader online retail market and lacking elements that have become commonplace among web merchants, such as in-store order pickup and an active social media presence.\n\nThat obstinacy has paid off—for now. In both June and July, Costco’s sales growth at U.S. stores open for more than a year blew past analysts’ estimates. And overall revenue growth has bested warehouse rival Sam’s Club, owned by Wal-Mart, for much of the past five years. But Costco’s laissez-faire approach to online could prove a dangerous long-term game.\n\nOn the one hand, “they have a business model that is working, so why break it?” says Robin Sherk, an analyst at consultant Kantar Retail. Yet “if Costco waits too long, they might find themselves too far behind.”\n\nCostco’s reluctance to embrace the web is understandable. Its warehouse club business model is based on selling a limited assortment of bulk-size food and household items at low prices, alongside an ever-changing selection of general merchandise—everything from margarita machines to kayaks. This creates an in-store treasure hunt experience. Both elements are costly and difficult to replicate online.\n\n“The way their business is set up, there’s no easy way to step into e-commerce,” says Kirthi Kalyanam, director of the Retail Management Institute at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business. “The economics are not viable.”\n\nWhile Costco offers more items online (about 10,000) than it does in its typical store (4,000), its members spend more when they’re inside its cavernous warehouses, tempted by free food samples and cheap cases of cabernet. Members also skew on the older side, so they’re not exactly digital trailblazers. “Costco shoppers enjoy shopping there: They don’t mind hoisting a 20-gallon tub of mayo,” says independent e-commerce analyst Sucharita Mulpuru.\n\nRecognizing this, Costco has plowed most of its capital into surer bets such as geographic expansion, most recently into France and Iceland, where about 20 percent of households in the greater Reykjavik area are now members of Costco’s local warehouse. The retailer is also squeezing more out of its shoppers by raising the annual membership fees that generate most of its profits.\n\nThe company’s “probably a little stubborn” when it comes to e-commerce, Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti has said, but that’s because “we still want you to come into the warehouse, of course.”\n\nCostco’s slow approach to the web is also cultural: The executive running its online efforts has been with the company since 1992. In contrast, Wal-Mart’s U.S. e-commerce business is run by Marc Lore, who sold a previous web merchant to Amazon and joined the world’s biggest retailer when Wal-Mart bought his startup Jet.com last year. He added deep e-commerce know-how and contacts to the discounter. “Jet brought something that Wal-Mart would never have figured out on their own,” says Barclays Capital Inc. analyst Karen Short.\n\nCostco has taken some baby steps: improving its search function, adding new products such as Samsung appliances and Reebok sneakers, and making it easier to track and return orders. It’s working with third-party distribution outfits Google Express, Shipt, and Instacart to share the costs of processing online orders. It’s also rolled out members-only perks, such as a gift registry for brides and expectant parents. “They do not need to ramp it up until their members defect,” says Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Brandon Fletcher.\n\nBut just adding new brick-and-mortar stores may not be enough, especially since each additional location steals sales from existing units. That cannibalization has increased in recent months, particularly outside the U.S., according to Wells Fargo Securities analyst Zachary Fadem. And Costco’s stellar in-store performance will become less potent as retail spending continues to move online. The company’s 11 percent growth rate for digital sales lags not only Wal-Mart and Target but also the overall e-commerce market, which is expanding about 15 percent annually, according to researcher EMarketer.\n\nPotentially more worrisome: Half of Costco’s shoppers are Amazon Prime members, Kantar Retail says, up from 14 percent five years ago. Sharing too many of the same subscribers could be risky, since Planet Retail RNG analyst Graham Hotchkiss says Amazon now offers many bulk-size goods at prices that rival Costco’s. And Amazon’s pending $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods Market Inc. will give it a firm foothold in groceries—the primary reason people shop at Costco, according to Barclays’s Short.\n\nOne remedy, she says, would be an acquisition on par with Wal-Mart’s Jet.com purchase. Others think Costco should offer in-store pickup of online orders, known as click-and-collect. But Galanti says he doesn’t want to sacrifice valuable space in the warehouses to do that, creating an opportunity for rivals BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc. and Sam’s Club, whose Club Pickup service is growing about 30 percent a quarter.\n\nCostco executives don’t view its current store-centric state as particularly hurtful. “I think we have been moving faster in the last few years,” Galanti says. “Some think we should move faster than that.” And Costco may take comfort in the knowledge that it’s not the only big retailer to thrive without a full-fledged online strategy. Discount chain T.J. Maxx, owned by TJX Companies Inc., also relies on customers discovering great items on the cheap in its stores. But TJX’s sales fell short of forecasts earlier this year as the brand-name labels it carries were increasingly found on Amazon and other sites. Analysts say the folks at Costco would be wise to take notice.","author":"Matthew Boyle","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-24T10:00:20.118Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iIHNrEwtkIlw/v0/1200x630.jpg","digest":"tNHSJIIGNB9EG1+dP5o6Ig==\n"}

Four weeks before Germany’s election on Sept. 24, the comments underscore her conviction that there was a humanitarian need to open the border when a record influx of refugees made their way through southern and eastern Europe to Germany that year.\n\nFor a QuickTake Q\u0026A on Merkel’s election challenges, click here.\n\nPart of the problem in the buildup to the 2015 crisis is that Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Italy were too often left alone by other European Union countries to deal with refugees arriving from outside the bloc, Merkel was quoted as saying. She renewed her campaign pledge that Germany “should never again witness” such an emergency.\n\nMerkel’s open-borders stance depressed her approval ratings last year and spurred the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party after a record number of 980,000 asylum seekers, many of them fleeing war in Syria, arrived in Germany in 2015. Critics included U.S. President Donald Trump, who called Merkel’s policy a “catastrophic mistake” in an interview with European media.\n\nMerkel’s poll numbers rebounded as the influx ebbed to 280,000 last year, restricted by border closures along the so-called Balkan route and a refugee accord between the EU and Turkey. Some 106,000 asylum seekers arrived in the first seven months of 2017, led by Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans, according to German Interior Ministry figures.\n\nFor Bloomberg’s interactive German coalition builder, click here.\n\nSupport for Merkel’s Christian Democratic-led bloc declined 1 percentage point to 38 percent while her main opponent, the Social Democrats led by challenger Martin Schulz, also fell 1 point to 23 percent, according to a weekly Emnid poll for Bild am Sonntag newspaper.\n\nAt the same time, 51 percent of Germans would vote for Merkel if the chancellor were elected directly, compared with 22 percent for Schulz, according to the newspaper. That compares with a 39-38 percent edge for Merkel in January, when Schulz’s emergence as her main challenger gave the SPD a temporary poll boost.\n\nThe pro-business Free Democrats and the Alternative for Germany gained one point each in the weekly survey, polling 9 percent and 8 percent respectively, with the anti-capitalist Left party unchanged at 9 percent and the Greens declining 1 point to 7 percent.\n\nMerkel, 63, has governed with the Social Democrats in a “grand coalition” for eight of her 12 years in office, including the last four. Surveys suggest the numbers may not add up on election day for a coalition with a smaller party such as the Free Democrats, her second-term partner. Emnid polled 1,979 people between Aug. 17 and Aug. 23. No margin or error was given.","author":"Richard Weiss","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-27T00:00:00.000Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iNL61eWjsYZE/v0/1200x800.jpg","digest":"WnrDUbhmTQ6mmJav5oZ2KA==\n"}

He did it in what he said would be his final fight, against a man who had never been in a professional boxing match before.\n\nMcGregor boxed surprisingly well but after landing some shots in the early rounds, his punches seemed to lose their steam. Mayweather then went on the pursuit. McGregor backpedaled most of the way, stopping only to throw an occasional flurry as Mayweather wore him down.\n\n\"I turned him into a Mexican tonight,\" McGregor said. \"He fought like a Mexican.\"\n\nThough Byrd cautioned McGregor for hitting behind the head on two different occasions, there were no real fouls in the fight and McGregor never tried to revert to any MMA tactics\n\nMcGregor had vowed to knock Mayweather out within two rounds, and he won the early rounds with movement and punches to the head. But the tide of the fight turned in the fourth round as Mayweather seemed to figure out what he had to do and began aggressively stalking McGregor.\n\nMayweather was credited with landing more than half his punches, as he solved McGregor's defense after a few rounds. Ringside stats showed him landing 170 of 320 punches to 111 of 430 for McGregor.\n\nIn a fight so intriguing that it cost $10,000 for ringside seats, McGregor turned in a respectable performance for someone in his first fight. He switched from southpaw to conventional at times and used his jab well, but Mayweather's experience and his ring savvy paid off as he executed his game plan to perfection.\n\n\"Our game plan was to take our time, go to him and take him out in the end,\" Mayweather said. \"I guaranteed everybody this fight wouldn't go the distance.\n\nMcGregor was trailing badly on all three ringside scorecards through the ninth round, with scores of 89-81, 89-81 and 87-83. The Associated Press had it 87-84.\n\nMayweather was widely criticized for not going after Pacquiao in their megafight, and he didn't make the same mistake this time. In a fight that could make him $200 million, he seemed to stagger McGregor with a series of punches in the ninth round, landing at will as McGregor desperately tried to clinch.\n\nThe end was near as the two fighters came out for the 10th round and Mayweather went right after McGregor again. He landed a punch that set McGregor reeling across the ring, then landed a combination that had McGregor defenseless as Byrd moved in to stop the bout. McGregor didn't complain when the fight was stopped and went over and hugged Mayweather.\n\n\"I was a little fatigued,\" he said. \"He was composed in there, that's what 50 pro fights can give you.\"\n\nHe seemed almost happy in the ring afterward, secure that he had given a good performance even in losing.\n\n\"I thought it was close though and I thought it was a bit of an early stoppage. I was just a little fatigued.\"\n\nMcGregor's challenge of Mayweather was fueled by social media and turned into a spectacle as the two fighters promoted the bout. It figured to make him $100 million or so, and gave McGregor a name and brand outside of the UFC.\n\nHe also got some respect from a fighter who has been in the ring his entire life.\n\n\"He's a lot better than I thought he'd be,\" Mayweather said. \"He's a tough competitor, but I was the better man tonight.\"\n\nAfter all the talk and hype, the fight unfolded like most in boxing figured it would. Mayweather, a 5-1 favorite, took a few rounds to establish his dominance but once he did it was a one-sided fight.\n\nMayweather ran his record to 50-0, surpassing Rocky Marciano's 49-0 record and giving himself a great parting gift. He repeated afterward that he was not going to fight again.\n\n\"This is my last fight for sure. 50-0 sounds good, I'm looking forward to going into the Hall of Fame,\" Mayweather said. \"I picked the best dance partner to do it with.\n\nIrish fans arrived by the thousands in the days before the fight, filling the arena for the weigh-in and boisterously cheering for their man. They even went off in the middle of the night and spray painted an Irish flag and \"49-1\" on a billboard on Interstate 15 promoting Mayweather's businesses.\n\nThe capacity crowd of 14,623 cheered McGregor on, but they quieted as the fight progressed and Mayweather showed his dominance.","author":"","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-27T00:20:09.776Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iSSCSGXnrQb4/v0/1200x829.jpg","digest":"zs3TBINs0v3uKILF+3aW8g==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"59bdaaea03c1c0e548b2bfd6"},"description":"The pharma company reformulated a cancer drug to treat MS and jacked up the price.","title":"How Roche Tweaked an Aging Drug to Keep Profits Rolling In","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-23/how-roche-tweaked-an-aging-drug-to-keep-profits-rolling-in","text":"In the remote forests of northern Sweden, Anders Svenningsson’s multiple sclerosis patients have benefited from a drug he’s been prescribing for the past eight years. It doesn’t require weekly injections, doesn’t leave patients feeling achy and feverish; and most important, halts their disease. That drug, Rituxan—originally developed to treat cancer—has become Sweden’s most prescribed medicine for MS, in which the body attacks its own central nervous system. Swedish doctors have great freedom to prescribe treatments they believe are appropriate, but few MS patients elsewhere can get the drug. That’s because its maker, Roche Holding AG, has never tried to sell it for the disease. Instead, Roche this year introduced a nearly identical medication that it markets under a new name and at 10 times the cost.\n\nThe tale of the two drugs highlights how pharmaceutical companies tweak aging medications to keep the profits rolling in. With Rituxan facing the expiration of its patent starting in the middle of this decade and another drugmaker due a share of the profit from the medication, Roche didn’t pursue it as a treatment for MS despite studies indicating it probably works. Instead, Roche invested in the offshoot medicine, which would take years to reach the market but enjoy longer protection against generics. That strategy began paying off in July, when the new drug, Ocrevus, wildly outperformed expectations in its first quarter of sales.\n\nStephen Hauser, a neurology professor at the University of California at San Francisco who led MS trials for both drugs, says the two have some minor differences. But doctors and patients must decide whether it’s worth buying Ocrevus, which he says is “10 percent more effective, 10 percent easier to administer, but 10 times more expensive.” Ocrevus runs $65,000 a year, while Rituxan costs about $2,400 annually in Sweden and $8,000 to $10,000 in the U.S. for patients who can get it prescribed for MS.\n\nRoche argues that there are significant differences between Rituxan and Ocrevus. Because the newer formula is composed mostly of human genetic components, it has fewer side effects and patients won’t develop as much resistance to it, the company says. “Ocrevus was specifically engineered for long-term use in patients with chronic diseases,” says Daniel O’Day, head of Roche’s pharmaceutical unit.\n\nWhen Roche decided to abandon Rituxan as a treatment for MS about a decade ago and focus on Ocrevus instead, “I felt it was immoral, because we had very good data” showing the older medication worked, says Timothy Vollmer, a neurology professor at the University of Colorado’s health sciences center. Vollmer says some insurers will pay for Rituxan, so he prescribes the one that will be cheaper for patients, because “I don’t have a reason to distinguish between them other than cost.”\n\nIt’s not uncommon for drugmakers to bolster their profits by reformulating medications and charging more for the new versions—though the companies always say they’re safer and more effective. Ocrevus is one of at least 10 MS drugs that have been revamped to boost their moneymaking potential, according to the Blizard Institute, a medical research center in London. Insulin producers have for decades made small improvements to keep prices high. Johnson \u0026 Johnson in 2007 rejiggered an antipsychotic formula to extend its patent protection. And Roche a decade ago developed an eye drug similar to its cancer medicine Avastin but priced about 40 times higher.\n\nIn the U.S., where the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation estimates that more than 400,000 people have the disease, neurologists have embraced Ocrevus. Since it got U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in March, Ocrevus has generated almost $200 million in sales, the best drug launch in Roche’s history. Approval in Europe is expected this year, and analysts predict it will top $3.5 billion annually by 2021. By contrast, Rituxan, which is widely prescribed for lymphoma, was never cleared for multiple sclerosis and probably never will be. A few thousand Americans with MS take the drug because their doctors prescribe it anyway.\n\nRituxan was among the first therapies to fight cancer by attaching to a specific protein. Its target is found on a type of white blood cell called a B cell. After it was shown to help people with various autoimmune diseases, researchers surmised it might also prevent the immune systems of MS patients from attacking the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. It was a new theory—doctors had thought another type of white blood cell played a bigger role—but the medicine worked. In 2007, a decade after Rituxan was first approved for blood cancer, a Roche trial showed that MS patients who took the drug had about 90 percent less scarring in their brains than people who took a placebo. Although a second study a year later failed in the toughest-to-treat type of MS, the results were encouraging enough to spur hopes that it would be effective for some of those patients, too.\n\nAnnette Langer-Gould, a former assistant medical director at Genentech Inc., the Roche biotech affiliate where Rituxan and Ocrevus originated, helped create a development plan for the two drugs. “How the medications work is exactly the same,” says Langer-Gould, now a researcher at health giant Kaiser Permanente, which has about 1,000 MS patients taking Rituxan. While both use proteins from humans and mice, she says, Ocrevus is “a little less mouse.” Genentech decided to push forward with Ocrevus mostly because the company could charge a higher price, according to Langer-Gould. Rituxan and other treatments for lymphoma were significantly cheaper than MS drugs, she says, but Roche couldn’t arbitrarily increase the price for cancer patients. Roche says the decision “was based on scientific and medical considerations so people with MS could have the medicine with the highest potential benefit.”\n\nEven as Roche was backing away from Rituxan for MS, neurologists began to embrace it on their own. While running an MS center in the Swedish city of Umea, Svenningsson was impressed by trial results. He started prescribing Rituxan and saw a notable improvement in patients’ day-to-day lives. Some 3,500 Swedish MS patients take Rituxan, which has proved more effective than many rival drugs designed for MS, according to the Karolinska Institutet, the Swedish research center where Svenningsson now works. Unlike older treatments that cause flu-like symptoms and sometimes must be administered every other day, Rituxan is given via injection once or twice a year. “As patients got to the end of the trial, they said, ‘Please don’t give me back that old stuff again,’ ” Svenningsson says. “ ‘Let me continue with this.’ ” —With Susan Decker","author":"Naomi Kresge","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-23T04:01:14.284Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ibw9s0S6Wask/v1/1200x802.jpg","digest":"jW8vl46Iypl0orKdOGxpgw==\n"}

While there's no doubt it is melting, scientists have little certainty about exactly what's happening inside this 10,000-year-old ice roughly three times the size of Texas. Last winter was the warmest on record in the Arctic, and as Greenland heats up, understanding this glaciate has become essential to navigating our future.\n\nThat's why scientists need narwhals, whales with 9 foot long unicorn-like tusks, which are some of the only mammals benefiting from all that melting ice.\n\n“The narwhals like it,” said Josh Willis, the project lead for NASA’s Oceans Melting Greenland. When melting ice falls into the sea, it churns up the water, bringing such food as plankton and krill to the surface. The whales tend to feed at the bottom of melting glaciers and can dive to depths of 1,800 meters, precisely the areas that OMG needs to survey. It’s a perfect match.\n\n“Narwhals are oceanographers,” said Kristin Laidre, a University of Washington marine biologist.\n\nMale narwhal sparring near Baffin Island, Canada. Photographer: Flip Nicklin/Minden Pictures RM via Getty Images\n\nThe five-year, $10 million OMG study is designed to measure the seasonal ebb and flow of the glaciers using a combination of the whales, satellites, temperature and salinity probes, as well as airborne and ship-based observations of the sea floor. Ultimately, the study aims to determine how quickly Greenland’s ice will disappear.\n\n“Will it take 1,000 years, a few hundred, or will we lose most of it in 50 years,” asked Willis. “That’s the part we don’t understand.”\n\nLairde’s work with narwhals isn’t as novel as it sounds. Seals have been used to map the ocean floor of Antarctica. Sharks have done the same thing in the Pacific. Germany’s Max Planck Institute has developed Icarus, a tiny sensor that turns everything from birds to bees into environmental beacons to predict weather and natural disasters.\n\nThe depth of glaciers has historically been difficult—and costly—to study accurately. “Arctic work is logistically complicated and expensive,” said Laidre. A single project requires hundreds of thousands of dollars for chartered planes, ships, equipment, power, and people.\n\nSo far, OMG has measured Greenland’s seafloor and mapped the continental shelf, a crucial piece in the melt puzzle. “Ancient glaciers carved these troughs through the continental shelf,” Willis said. The channels allow warm water to flow between the glaciers, eating away at the ice. Unfortunately, “a lot more of these glaciers sit in deeper water than we expected,” he said.\n\nWillis fears that future, more accurate projections of Greenland mass loss “are probably going to have to be revised upward.” If they are, we’ll have narwhals to thank for the data.","author":"Adam Popescu","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-24T10:00:06.653Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iObrX.W_9uzQ/v1/1200x801.jpg","digest":"wOj3FoFiYUiTGE/tOxUI2A==\n"}

National Weather Service and local officials are advising Houston-area residents to avoid traveling.\n\nThree to 4 inches of rainfall were reported in the region in one hour's time. First responders investigated the report of a woman swept away in her vehicle by floodwaters.\n\n\"Stay put,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"It's going to last four to five days,\" said Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, who urged drivers to stay off the road. \"This is Day One.\"\n\nHard-hit Rockport\n\nTexans who rode out the most powerful hurricane to hit the United States in a decade ventured out on Saturday to see what was left of their neighborhoods in what was \"now turning into a deadly inland event.\"\n\nThe first fatality was reported in the hard-hit coastal city of Rockport, where the person died in a house fire during the storm, Aransas County Judge Burt Mills said Saturday afternoon. \"We didn't know about it until today,\" he said.\n\nAt least a dozen people were injured, Mills said.\n\nWith dire warnings of tornadoes, torrential downpours and days of flooding to come, broad swaths of southeast Texas were littered with uprooted trees, toppled signs, flagpoles that snapped like toothpicks and clusters of bricks peeled like scabs from walls and rooftops.\n\nAdditional fatalities were feared in Rockport, where an estimated 5,000 residents had stayed put for the storm that blasted ashore as a Category 4 around 11 p.m. ET Friday between Port Aransas and Port O'Connor, Aransas County Sheriff Bill Mills said.\n\nA damaged home sits amid a flood on Saturday after Hurricane Harvey slammed Rockport, Texas.\n\nCallers to the local emergency dispatch line told of walls and roofs collapsing on people across the city, where an official had warned those who opted to stick out the storm to write their Social Security numbers on their arms for body identification.\n\nCNN meteorologist and severe weather expert Chad Myers warned residents of Houston to move to higher ground.\n\n\"The storm isn't moving, but the rain bands are moving like a pinwheel,\" he said. \"You are going to get a pinwheel (Saturday night) that will wake up -- or you'll wake up with 12-18 inches of new rainfall on the ground.\"\n\nRockport home sliced in half from Hurricane Harvey.\n\nShortly after Harvey became a tropical storm, with sustained winds of 70 mph, Saturday afternoon, Gov.

Some places even far inland were predicted to get as much as 40 inches of rain through Wednesday.\n\nWhile the worst of the storm surge had ended by midday Saturday, the coastal flooding threat was due to increase as already-swollen rivers and bayous get pounded with heavy rain, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said. Sea water pushed onto the shore also won't recede quickly, he said, meaning \"this is going to be a long, ongoing flood event.\"\n\nAbbott said the 210-mile-long corridor between Corpus Christi and Houston was expected to receive as much as 30 more inches of rain on top of the double-digit rainfall figures that had already fallen.\n\n#Harvey made landfall at 10 PM CDT as a category 4 hurricane near Rockport, Texas, with max winds of 130 mph and min pressure of 938 mb. pic.twitter.com/98y5wpKmBw — NHC Atlantic Ops (@NHC_Atlantic) August 26, 2017\n\nHarvey wielded the \"highest potential to kill the most amount of people and cause the most amount of damage,\" Brock Long, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, had warned.

The Houston office of the National Weather Service reported 12 twisters in its area. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said deputies saw a possible tornado near Cypress Fairbanks, just outside Houston. There were no immediate reports of injuries. \"We're seeing extensive damage to properties,\" he said.\n\n-- Structural and building problems were reported in Rockport, Aransas Pass, and Port Aransas, Texas, said Tom Beal, a meteorologist with National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi.\n\n-- Corpus Christi officials tweeted Saturday afternoon that evacuees could return \"but be advised we are under a water boil advisory \u0026 limited wastewater usage due to outages at treatment plants.\"\n\n-- Coast Guard helicopters rescued 15 people aboard three vessels in distress near Port Aransas on Saturday, according to Capt. Tony Hahn, commander of Coast Guard Sector Corpus Christi.\n\n-- About 25% of oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico has been halted because of Hurricane Harvey, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement announced Saturday evening.\n\n-- President Donald Trump tweeted early Saturday that he's \"closely monitoring\" Harvey from Camp David, Maryland.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bdab0e03c1c0e548b2bfec"},"description":"Joe and Gordon’s next project might be dead on arrival, and Cameron and Donna come face to face","title":"'Halt and Catch Fire' Recap: Rehashing The Past, Pushing Into The Future","url":"http://ew.com/recap/halt-and-catch-fire-season-4-episode-3/","text":"Last week’s exceptional two-hour premiere was mainly concerned with setting the stage for the show’s final season. Now, it’s finally time to move forward on this season’s technological gambit: navigate the world of search. However, before our favorite innovators can push forward into the future, they must first rehash some old problems and dynamics. Joe, Cameron, Gordon, and Donna believe they’ve moved on, but the simplest thing triggers memories of past pain to come to the surface.\n\nIt’s clear “Miscellaneous” will deal with the past from the first scene of the episode. Cameron is sitting in a bathtub, her eyes fixed on the dripping water from the faucet. That small detail transports Cameron back to when she told Tom she slept with Joe because their kitchen sink was leaking then, too. Tom, via flashback, is convinced that Cameron loves Joe, but she says she doesn’t.\n\n“There’s no loving Joe,” she says.” He’s empty and he just becomes whatever circumstance needs him to be.”\n\nAs she says this to Tom in the past, we see her inquisitively strolling around Joe’s apartment, examining this catalog life he has built for himself. That emotionally painful conversation with Tom is clearly on her mind because she’s right back where she was three seasons ago: in a relationship with Joe. Now, she’s forced to wonder if her assessment of Joe is right. Can this relationship work, or it is impossible to love this dreamer? Her memories aren’t the only sign of her apprehension. As we learn later on, she still hasn’t unpacked any of her boxes even though Joe, who really wants to make this work even though her messiness clashes with his pristine aesthetic, has been asking her to.\n\nGordon, who discovers Cameron at Joe’s apartment when he comes looking for him, is very much against Joe and Cameron getting back together because he, too, remembers how it turned out the last time. He tells Joe as much in a hilarious outburst at the office that morning; however, Joe stops listening because he’s distracted by the Haley’s Comet website. The scene is definitely played for comedy, which is indicative of the writers’ ability to undercut any melodrama with a heavy dose of humor.\n\nFrom there, we time-jump ahead to Gordon and Joe as they finish signing away their company. Gordon’s bummed about it, but Joe is re-energized because he’s already found the next big thing: Haley’s website. In yet another hilarious scene, Joe and Gordon sit down with Haley to discuss the project. In classic Joe form, he manages to brag about his brilliance himself while also complimenting her. (“The indexing was obviously mine,” but Haley’s execution was “wonderful,” he says.). But Joe and Gordon aren’t on the same page. Joe wants to pay Haley $20,000 for her idea, which Gordon, rightly so, finds ridiculous. It doesn’t matter though: It turns out Haley doesn’t even want the money. She wants to work on the project with them. Joe says yes without even consulting Gordon — you know, her dad — because he’s on a roll.\n\nMeanwhile, Donna is trying to protect her position at work. Trip comes to her with an idea for a web/browser play, and that puts her on the defensive. After everything she’s been through in the past three seasons, she’s very paranoid. She shares her concerns with Diane at a conference later that day, but Diane isn’t too concerned. Donna quickly forgets her fears when she spots a sign for the “MISC: Future of Gaming” panel. Can you guess who is listed as one of the panelists?\n\nYep, it’s Cameron. In the same way that seeing the Comet website woke Joe up, seeing Cameron’s name does the same for Donna, and she’s ready to lash out. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, but Cameron clashes with her fellow panelists, who believe Doom is the future of gaming. Though she tries her hardest to stay on message, Cameron is Cameron, and she calls Atari out for delaying the game, much to Donna’s amusement. In fact, Donna steps up to the mic to ask a very pointed question about the relationship between the creative side and business side, which leads to them rehashing the Mutiny debacle in front of everyone. Cameron still blames Donna for everything that happened and doesn’t believe she played a part in it at all. But it’s clear later on when Donna reads a very negative review of Cameron’s new game (more on this in a minute) that part of her still cares for her.

(2:06)\n\nFootball is the ultimate team sport, and while the quarterback is the most important player, he still has only limited control of what his team does each game.\n\nWe wanted a way to isolate a quarterback's value when he threw or ran the ball relative to what the rest of his team did on every other play. The method for this was to collect data on expected points added (EPA) from ESPN Stats \u0026 Information research. Every play has an expected point total based on factors such as down, distance to go, field position, home-field advantage and time remaining. The higher the EPA, the more successful that play was at helping the team score the game's next points.\n\nBasically, if a quarterback had a great season despite not getting much help from his team's running game or defense, then he'll have a much higher EPA relative to the team's EPA, showing his value, and suggesting that he needs more help around him. Even if the quarterback had an average individual season, a terrible team EPA will prove that he's likely far less of the problem than the rest of the team's flaws.\n\nMore people play on ESPN than anywhere else. Join or create a league in the No. 1 Fantasy Football game! Sign up for free!\n\nWhen we turn our attention toward the least valuable quarterbacks of 2016, we are mostly looking at quarterbacks who held their teams back in the passing game while the other team elements (running game, defense, special teams) were usually strong.\n\nSome of these quarterbacks still made the playoffs, and some have even been to the Super Bowl before. However, 2016 was not their finest moment. Four quarterbacks even produced less EPA than their teams did, which is difficult to do when so many of the game's biggest plays that lead to points come in the passing game.\n\nWe should also note that measuring EPA on passing plays does not separate the quarterback from his receivers or pass blockers. So this measurement filters out the quarterback from the running game, defense and special teams, but not from the rest of his team's pass offense.\n\nRead through our various categories of passers, or skip ahead to the metric of your choice here:\n\nLeast valuable | Most valuable | Least aggressive | Most aggressive | Least accurate | Most accurate\n\nNote: Each quarterback's total EPA and his team's EPA is listed, and the rankings are out of 30 quarterbacks/teams.\n\nQB EPA: minus-12.3 (27th)\n\nTeam EPA: plus-37.1 (second)\n\nQB-added value: minus-49.4\n\nThis is a bad look for a two-time highest-paid player in NFL history. Baltimore missed the playoffs for the third time in four years after Flacco squandered the second-highest team EPA of 2016. While the Ravens did not have much of a ground attack (26th in EPA), they did support Flacco with the No. 8 defense in EPA (plus-9.5) and the best special teams (plus-58.6) by a wide margin. In fact, where would the Ravens be without kicker Justin Tucker? He made 38 field goals (out of 39 attempts) while the offense contributed only 30 touchdowns.\n\nJoe Flacco has been at the helm of a handful of playoff victories in his career, but his performance held the Ravens back in 2016.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bdab2403c1c0e548b2bffa"},"description":"The Jets' unsettled quarterback situation didn't get any clarity Saturday, as Christian Hackenberg struggled mightily while Bryce Petty was injured.","title":"Christian Hackenberg flops, Bryce Petty injured, as Jets' QB plot thickens","url":"http://www.espn.com/blog/new-york/jets/post/_/id/70680/christian-hackenberg-flops-bryce-petty-injured-as-jets-qb-plot-thickens","text":"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- What now?\n\nThe New York Jets have turned their quarterback competition into a three-wing circus, creating a highly unusual, no-win situation as they look toward the season opener in 14 days. The tally after three games: Josh McCown is rusty, Christian Hackenberg isn't close to being ready and Bryce Petty is gaining -- but injured.\n\nHackenberg started for the second straight week and was awful again, throwing two interceptions (both returned for touchdowns) in a 32-31 loss to the New York Giants on Saturday night at MetLife Stadium. He threw a late touchdown pass after Petty was hurt, as the Jets almost erased a 29-3 deficit, but it didn't change the story for Hackenberg. He did nothing against the Giants' starters.\n\nCoach Todd Bowles is expected to announce the opening-day starter on Monday or Tuesday. McCown is the most qualified quarterback, but he hasn't played a game in two weeks. Curiously, he didn't see any action against the Giants; he has played only one series (seven plays) in the preseason, meaning he'd be ill-prepared for Week 1. Presumably, the starters won't play in the final game.\n\nTaking a long-range view, Bowles devoted the heart of the preseason to evaluating his two young quarterbacks. By doing so, he might have hurt the team in the short term. Unless McCown is injured -- there have been whispers of a tired arm -- this was a weird approach, even by Jets standards.\n\nChristian Hackenberg's stint against the Giants' starting defense was a disaster, as he threw two pick-sixes. Brad Penner/USA TODAY Sports\n\nQB depth chart: Petty (15-for-18, 250 yards) stole the night, throwing three touchdown passes in the second half, but he injured his left knee with two minutes remaining in the game of his NFL life. A teammate rolled up on his leg, and he was unable to put weight on it. He has had rotten luck with injuries in his short career.\n\nIt was cruel ending for Petty, who finished with a perfect passer rating -- 158.3. He was fantastic, but perspective is important: He did it against the Giants' backups. He didn't have to deal with Landon Collins and Jason Pierre-Paul, as Hackenberg did. Give Petty some credit, though: He made plays, showing the ability to improvise. He was the first Jets' quarterback since Ray Lucas (2000) to have three TD passes in a preseason game.\n\nHackenberg (12-for-21, 126 yards) wanted to get off to a quick start -- it was a point of emphasis in practice -- but was sacked on the second play, a blindside safety blitz. On the third series, Hackenberg threw a horrible pass in the flat and was picked off by Collins, who scored. Hackenberg's second interception wasn't his fault; it went off the hands of Robby Anderson. Facing a very good defense, the field looked 150 yards long with Hackenberg in the game.\n\nOne reason to be concerned: Defensive end Leonard Williams injured his left wrist in the second quarter and didn't return. Uh, oh. Williams, later spotted wearing a heavy wrap, is arguably the Jets' best player and they can't afford to lose him for a long period of time.\n\nWhen it was starters vs. starters, the Jets looked : Brutal on offense. The Jets gave away 16 points with two turnovers and a safety. No team is good enough to overcome mistakes of that magnitude, especially a team with personnel deficiencies such as the Jets. The starting defense played a solid game, especially Sheldon Richardson, who was unblockable. He recorded a sack and forced an interception by drilling Eli Manning on his release.\n\nWelcome (back), Matt: After sitting out two games with a hamstring injury, Matt Forte (10 carries for 43 yards) made his preseason debut and showed nice elusiveness for a guy who missed three weeks of practice. His backfield partner, Bilal Powell, displayed plenty of giddy-up on an 89-yard catch and run for a touchdown. That's a good sign; the Jets will be leaning heavily on their two running backs.\n\nThat guy could start: They need a starter at right tackle. Who wants the job? Brandon Shell got the start but was roughed up by the Giants' imposing front. He allowed a sack and missed a block on a safety (Forte tackled in the end zone). Maybe the Jets will turn to Brent Qvale -- again. The entire first-team offensive line had a tough time with the Giants' front.\n\nRookie watch: After a slow start in camp, wide receiver ArDarius Stewart (two touchdowns) and Chad Hansen (two catches for 45 yards) finally showed up in a game. Stewart showed nice body control on an over-the-shoulder catch in the end zone; his other score resulted from a busted coverage. They could open the season as the fourth and fifth receivers.","author":"Rich CiminiESPN Staff Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-27T01:33:20.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0826%2Fr249503_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"kNBDRDWlQF7AwSnHzoBKNw==\n"}

David Price, meanwhile, hasn't pitched since July 24 thanks to a recurrence of stiffness in his balky left elbow. In case you forgot, that's the Red Sox's de facto captain and second-best starter, respectively, both on the disabled list without a timetable for their return and no guarantee they will be back this season.\n\nBoston's lead in the American League East fell to 3.5 games after the Red Sox got shut out by Baltimore on Saturday. Winslow Townson/USA TODAY Sports\n\nBut the Sox had been winning without them. Through Wednesday night, when they beat Cleveland Indians ace Corey Kluber, they had won 16 of 20 games and seized a 4.5-game lead in the American League East in large measure because of the energy created by the promotion of top prospect Rafael Devers and the acquisition of versatile infielder Eduardo Nunez in a trade with the San Francisco Giants. With new blood coursing through the lineup, the Sox looked primed to run away with the division and surge into the playoffs.\n\nThen came the past three days. On Thursday, with ace Chris Sale on the mound, they lost 13-6 to the Indians. They returned home Friday night for a 16-3 mauling by the Baltimore Orioles, their most lopsided loss of the season. And on Saturday, they mustered four hits against Orioles starter Kevin Gausman and lost 7-0, the 10th time they have been shut out this season.\n\nThe games have been as ugly as the math. Since they put up four runs in the ninth inning Wednesday night, the Sox have been outscored 36-9 over the past 27 innings.\n\nMaybe it's just a speed bump along the way to defending the AL East crown. Or maybe it's a sign of trouble on the horizon. Regardless, Devers and Nunez were bound to get cold at some point. Sure enough, Devers is 2-for-27 with eight strikeouts in the past seven games, while Nunez is 6-for-28 with three extra-base hits.\n\nSo, perhaps the best thing that could be said for the past three days is that the cavalry might be on its way. While the Red Sox played four games in Cleveland, Pedroia and Price stayed behind with head athletic trainer Brad Pearson, and by all accounts they had a positive week. It culminated Saturday with Pedroia going through defensive drills before his round of batting practice and with Price long-tossing off flat ground from 120 feet.\n\nIf the Red Sox are pinpointing a return date for either player, they aren't discussing it publicly. It's probably wise not to rush them or offer false hope that they will be back.\n\nBut it's clear that the Sox need them, along with center fielder Jackie Bradley Jr. and reliever Matt Barnes, both of whom joined Pedroia and Price on the disabled list this week. And perhaps their returns in September could provide the same jolt that Devers' and Nunez's arrivals did in August.\n\n\"There's positive happenings, I think, on the injury front,\" manager John Farrell said. \"But with all due respect, we're not looking to wait for the next flow [of players] in here to inject some energy.\"\n\nIn other words, the Red Sox can't simply expect Pedroia and Price to return at their pre-injury levels. Even if Pedroia is able to return to the lineup, his knee issues might not permit him to stay there, at least not every day. And although Price pitched relatively well after missing the season's first two months with what he later described as a \"torn elbow,\" he might run out of time in the season to build back his arm strength for a return to the rotation.\n\nBut there's also every chance that Pedroia and Price can still make positive contributions, enough that it will pull the Red Sox out of their late-August funk and propel them into the stretch run.\n\nAfter that 36-9 margin over the past three days, they need all the help they can get.\n\n\"I guess the playoffs are right around the corner,\" Mookie Betts said. \"But you've got to take it one game at a time. You have to get there first.\"\n\nSaid Farrell: \"We have played a very good brand of baseball for a period of time. We're in a patch right now, the last three days, where it's the other side of it. The way to get out of it is for the guy on the mound to start the ballgame to lead us through it.\"\n\nAnother way is to hope the cavalry can ride back into town and save the day.","author":"Scott LauberESPN Staff Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-27T01:37:49.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0826%2Fr249491_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"cUU/c7192zbC+gleG21lfw==\n"}

And not a lot of punching from Mayweather, who was content to use his legendary defensive skills to frustrate McGregor. McGregor dropped his arms at one point, a tactic he has used in the U.F.C., as if to say, “Just try to hit me.” Mayweather did not take the bait.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n—-\n\nWant the big sports news, highlights and analysis from a rotating cast of Times journalists, delivered to your inbox once a week?

He slipped a left hand from McGregor and fired off a right hand of his own. It was a close round but probably went to Mayweather. Mayweather also landed a couple of good body blows.\n\nMather: Every McGregor punch that lands, or looks like it lands, gets a roar from the crowd. Judges have been known to be influenced by crowd reactions.\n\n5th: McGregor starting to look tired\n\nMcGregor seems to be swiping and tapping at Mayweather rather than throwing solid punches. It might be one sign of his inexperience in the boxing ring, as he is not used to throwing punches in close range the way that boxers do.\n\nLate in the round, Mayweather started to talk down to McGregor. He hit him with a solid overhand right and then came back with a left. McGregor is breathing a little heavier, and the two fighters have had some real tussles when they have locked up. Mayweather looks a bit frustrated at what seems to be some wrestling moves by McGregor.\n\nMather: Mayweather is doing less defending and more lashing out. Could he be waiting for McGregor to tire to unleash his full arsenal? And McGregor is starting to look tired.\n\nPhoto\n\n6th: Mayweather makes his move\n\nWith Mayweather’s back turned, McGregor was unleashing on him and the referee let it go on for a little longer than he probably should have. After appearing perturbed, Mayweather started going forward and unloading on McGregor, landing solid left-right combinations that got the arena to its feet. McGregor appears very tired and is not throwing back.\n\nFans have started with chants of “Conor,” but that appears to be doing little to uplift their fighter in a meaningful way. Although the fight is still pretty scrappy, Mayweather seems to be settling in.\n\nMather: Mayweather stung McGregor there several times, but eventually reverted to his defensive style. And another hands-behind-the-back display of bravado by McGregor as the round ends.\n\nPhoto\n\n7th: Mayweather’s speed gets to McGregor\n\nEven though McGregor is the bigger fighter, Mayweather certainly does not seem to be worried about his punching power. He is going forward, with his hands up, walking right through McGregor. In one moment, McGregor slid around Mayweather but was met with a right hook. Then Mayweather came back with a quick jab that hit McGregor before he could respond. Even though Mayweather is 40, the speed definitely is still there.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMather: Championship fights in the U.F.C. have 25 minutes of fighting time. McGregor is up to 21 here and might have to go 15 more. His fatigue level is the most important factor right now.\n\nPhoto\n\n8th: Mayweather starts taking control\n\nWhen they are clenching, Mayweather is positioning his body in a way that McGregor can only hit the back of his head. For most boxers, they would not throw that punch. But McGregor is not most boxers. He is hitting the back of Mayweather’s head, and the referee seems reluctant to do anything about it. Mayweather seems a little bit frustrated by that, but it’s not stopping him from landing some peppery right hands. Mayweather seems to be taking control.\n\nMather: McGregor is falling behind in this fight, but is still gamely slugging it out. This is far from the ridiculous mismatch some predicted.\n\nPhoto\n\n9th: McGregor, tired, looks like he’s had enough\n\nThings got off to a chippy start. McGregor came out and landed a stiff right hand and then he hit Mayweather on the belt line. Mayweather appeared to be hurt by it, but the referee did not call a low blow. When the referee got in between them and Mayweather approached, McGregor flicked him with a right hand.\n\nLate in the round, Mayweather came storming back with a series of right hands, that had McGregor leaning on the ropes with his mouth open.\n\n10th: A flurry from Mayweather, and the ref stops the fight\n\nThis fight’s over. Mayweather backed McGregor onto the ropes with a series of rights and lefts. McGregor’s face was red and swollen. He was staggering into the ropes when the referee stepped in to stop the fight with 1:55 remaining in the round.","author":"John Eligon and Victor Mather","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-27T03:44:04.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/27/sports/27fightlive-pre/27fightlive-pre-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"gXUGqSL1K3N0W/D4DWu2aQ==\n"}

Then their worlds collided in western Arkansas.","title":"At an Arkansas Mosque, a Vandal Spreads Hate and Finds Mercy","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/26/us/fort-smith-arkansas-mosque-vandalism-and-forgiveness.html","text":"Abraham Davis was sitting on a thin blue pad on the concrete floor of Cell 3 in a jail in western Arkansas when a guard came around with stamped envelopes and writing paper.\n\nThe first person he wrote to was his mother. Abraham, just shy of 21, had barely spoken to her since his arrest a few days before, and he had a lot to explain.\n\nIt all began on a night last October when he borrowed her white minivan and drove to the home of a friend. They’d gotten drunk on cheap whiskey. Kentucky Deluxe. Abraham agreed to drive his friend to a mosque in town. His friend drew swastikas and curses on the mosque’s windows and doors while Abraham stood watch in the driveway.\n\nThe next day, the vandalism was all over the news. Abraham watched the reports over and over on his phone, his stomach curdling with regret.\n\nEven now, as he was facing up to six years in prison for the act, Abraham could not explain why he had done it.\n\nHe had grown up in Fort Smith, a city of tall oak trees and brick churches that has the look of a faded Polaroid. His father, charismatic but violent, died when Abraham was 5, leaving him with a feeling of powerlessness so intense that he has been trying to conquer it ever since. “Most of my life I’ve spent trying to train myself to become something that’s too strong to be broken through,” he said. Life has teed him up for a fight, and he walks tilted slightly forward, as if someone is pulling him with an invisible wire.\n\nAs a poor student in the high school on the wealthier side of town, Abraham often felt like an outsider. He walked, not drove, hung out on playgrounds, not in restaurants. He got into a lot of fights. He did poorly in school, but he doesn’t remember his teachers seeming surprised. Expectations were low, and he bent to fit them. He slept a lot in class. At 18, he dropped out.\n\nFort Smith has two country clubs, several golf courses, a Talbots and a symphony orchestra. But a proliferation of pawnshops and a circuit court crowded with indigent defendants are reminders of the grinding poverty all around, in the rural areas of western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma.\n\nFor years, those divisions had been etched into the city’s geography. Poorer families lived on the north side of town and wealthier families on the south. Race followed the same pattern, with the south predominantly white and much of the city’s black population in the north.\n\nBut time has scrambled those old lines. Latinos came here to work in the poultry industry. Pho shops dot the city’s main drag, property of Vietnamese who began arriving as refugees after the fall of Saigon. R \u0026 R’s Curry Express serves deliciously spicy North Indian food at a Finish Line gas station.\n\nMuslims from different countries came, too — some to study, some to work in the city’s growing medical industry. Many had money. Hisham Yasin did not.\n\nA Palestinian who grew up just outside Damascus in Syria, Hisham sold fruits and vegetables in an outdoor market. He came to the United States in 1996, joining his parents and an older brother. Hisham imagined Beverly Hills, but found himself in western Arkansas in a rotting house with rats and cockroaches. He washed dishes at the Golden Corral. His father collected cans. He and a brother, Abdul Rahman, opened a used-car business. They called it A \u0026 H Auto Sales.\n\nToday, Hisham lives in a grand house in Fort Smith with sparkling chandeliers on the edge of a thick green forest of oak and pine. He is 49 and has the look of an affable neighborhood baker, with a big belly and a broad smile. He is giving his three children what he calls a “five-star life” compared with his own, which he says began at “below zero.” He follows the news about Syria daily. But Arkansas is his home. He considers the day he came to the United States — Feb. 11 — his birthday.\n\nHisham was one of the founders of the mosque that Abraham helped vandalize. They called it Al Salam — meaning “peace” in Arabic. Since 2009, it has been in a brick ranch formerly used as a law office. It is on a busy road, South 28th Street, between a library branch and a nursing home. The founders wanted it that way. They thought the Muslims of Fort Smith should be forthright and confident, not hiding somewhere off the beaten path. This, they believed, would gain the community’s trust and respect, maybe even help guard against the noxious stream of negative news about Muslims.\n\nThe truth was that until the vandalism, few people in Fort Smith knew that Muslims lived in their city.\n\nAbraham did. He had gone to high school with Hisham’s older son, Wasim Yasin. They often ate lunch together in the cafeteria. Sometimes it wasn’t easy being Muslim in high school, Wasim said. But around Abraham, it was.\n\n“Abraham was a good guy, a ‘whatever’ kind of guy, he never had any problems with that,” Wasim said. “You know how people can talk about Muslims. He came up to me and he said: ‘I’m with you, man. If anybody bothers you, just let me know. I’m your friend.’”\n\nMonths passed after the vandalism without contact from the police, and Abraham began to feel relief. He had only helped a friend, he told himself. “My mind was trying to let me off the hook,” he said.\n\nBut his dreams were less forgiving. In one, he was walking through a crowd of parents and their children. The children were looking at some writing and crying. “It was like one of those Scrooge stories,” he said. He could see the children, but they could not see him. He saw their frightened faces and woke up sweating.\n\nNow, sitting in the Sebastian County jail, Abraham was not entirely surprised he had ended up here. Expectations for him were so low — at his church, at school, even in his own mind — that he sometimes saw the line of his life pointing toward prison.\n\nBut not like this. Not with swastikas. So Abraham decided to use another piece of paper the jail guard had given him to write to the mosque. He wanted to tell the people there how sorry he was for what he’d done. What, after all, did he have to lose?\n\nHe sat on the floor of the cell, and placed a yellow sheet of paper on one of the metal seats bolted to the wall. He did not know the mosque’s name. So he copied it, a letter at a time, from his paperwork.\n\n“Dear Masjid Al Salam Mosque,” he began.\n\nCountering a Dark Impulse\n\nThe sky was just brightening the morning of Oct. 20 when Hisham pulled into the mosque’s driveway. He liked to do his morning prayers there when he could. The quiet of the early hour was soothing, and he’d been told that praying at the mosque meant more rewards from God. But he had not come to pray this morning. He had sped there in his white Infiniti, carrying his gun, after receiving a distressed phone call from the imam.\n\nAl Salam’s members had already been anxious. For months the year before, a man had sent the mosque disturbing emails. “Sharia is a cancer that must be eliminated,” the man warned, until someone called the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And the Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump was calling for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” Few thought that was possible, but it seemed to loosen some dark impulse in the land.\n\nRolling up to the mosque, Hisham saw the first swastika from the street, spray-painted in black on the bottom left corner of the small curbside sign. It was off-kilter, like a creeping spider.\n\nThere was more on the building: “Go Home” on the wooden front door, just above a babysitter-wanted sign. On the garage: “We Don’t Want You Here U.S.A.” And on one of the front windows, among profanities about Islam and Allah, a phrase Hisham did not recognize: “Deus Vult.” It is Latin for “It is God’s will” — a medieval rallying cry for the Crusades.\n\nHisham’s heart hurt. He thought about how little the vandals understood. America was the only true home Hisham had ever known. As a Palestinian in Syria he had been stateless. America gave him a country. America gave him a kidney, through a transplant. It gave him the dignity of being able to travel in the world. He still cries when he explains this.\n\n“They never let me go to Dubai,” Hisham said, blowing his nose and wiping his eyes. “Then I went with my American passport, and they stand up straight — they say, ‘You’re welcome, Mr. Hisham!’”\n\nAt the mosque that morning, Hisham sprang into action like a rescue worker after an earthquake. He called the police. He called the mosque’s board members. He called journalists.\n\nBy early afternoon, the story was breaking.\n\nThen something wonderful happened. The mosque’s phone started ringing, and didn’t stop. Churches called. A synagogue called. Buddhists called. So did residents who had seen the news or simply driven by. One man called, crying. His daughter had seen the graffiti on her way to work and told him about it. He said the vandals could not have been Christians. No true Christian would have done it.\n\nAnas Bensalah, a mosque member who had taken the day off to help with the cleanup, told the man that he understood completely: That was exactly how he felt every time there was an attack by the Islamic State.\n\nOver the next week, the mosque was snowed under with cards and letters. Some people brought flowers. Most of the letters were from Fort Smith and the surrounding towns, but some were from as far as Reston, Va.\n\nHisham was overjoyed. He kept them, as if they were jewels, in a drawer in his office.\n\n‘A Big Heart and a Short Fuse’\n\nThe night the mosque was vandalized, Kristin Collins, 45, had been worrying about her white minivan. There was a knocking sound under the hood, and it sometimes lurched unexpectedly. She was afraid the transmission was going, and she could not afford to fix it. Her last job was at a day care center in 2013. She quit after her husband, who had Parkinson’s, began having trouble putting diapers on their 1-year-old. The next year, Kristin learned she had leukemia. She and her husband receive disability insurance — a total of about $1,700 a month to support them, Kristin’s son Abraham and his younger brothers, Noah Davis and Gabriel Collins.\n\nFixing the van was on a long list of things they couldn’t afford: the $25 monster costume that Gabriel, 4, wanted for Halloween; the several thousand dollars in back rent on their small brick ranch house. Kristin sometimes had to go to church food banks at the end of the month. And she had the sinking feeling she would have to rely on charity for a turkey on Thanksgiving, only a month away.\n\nSo when Abraham asked to borrow the van, she was reluctant. Kristin loved her son. At 20, he was still more a teenager than a man, with a sparse goatee and — at 5 feet 11 inches and 139 pounds — a boyish frame. He was outgoing, loved people and liked to show off his break dancing and singing. She remembers his sweet head, hair dyed green, asleep on her hospital couch during her cancer treatment. But he was also directionless and unemployed, and spent too much time drinking and smoking pot with his friends.\n\nKristin’s boys were so different. Her middle son, Noah, was shy and sensitive but also a striver. He rose many days at 6 a.m. to work at a sandwich shop downtown. He had a girlfriend and a car. Where Noah was determined, Abraham just floated through, escaping into comic books and cartoons.\n\nYet the brothers, only 15 months apart, were extremely close. As kids they played pirates, drinking sweet tea as whiskey on bunk bed boats. Abraham was protective of Noah, a frequent target for bullies with his surgically repaired cleft palate. Abraham was also quick to fight. At 9, he pummeled a boy who had made fun of Noah.\n\nSomething was lodged in Abraham from the beginning, like a shard of glass in his heel. Kristin says it came from his father, Hud Davis, who grew up in a violent home. He had one real leg and cartoon flames painted on his fake one, the result of stepping on a downed power line. To his friends, he was full of life. At home, he was cruel. Kristin remembers him grabbing her by the neck and slamming her into the laundry-room door.\n\nNoah would sit on his toy dump truck and wheel himself backward into the closet to hide during the eruptions. Abraham remembers his father screaming that he would not have had to marry “your whore mother” if Abraham had not come along.\n\nAt 5, Abraham said, he got down on his knees in his bedroom and asked God “to take him and save my mom.” When his 33-year-old father died a month later, after a seizure, Abraham believed he was responsible.\n\nAs he grew older, Abraham had trouble controlling his anger. Hank Needham, the principal of Cavanaugh Elementary in Fort Smith, remembers him as a polite little boy — but one with an angry streak. He once threw a fit when the school took away his screwdriver, which had belonged to his father.\n\n“He had a big heart and a short fuse, and he’d just start cussing,” Mr. Needham said. “He had an adult mouth in the second grade.”\n\nMr. Needham gained Abraham’s trust, and medication for hyperactivity helped smooth his moods. By the sixth grade, he was an all-star student. His picture still hangs in a hallway promoting good attendance: Abraham, in a yellow sweatshirt, grinning.\n\nIt didn’t last. By the time he got to Southside High, Abraham had made peace with his place in the social hierarchy. He was, as he put it, “one of the outcasts.” But he was O.K. with that. He did not crave being in the popular crowd, which would have been impossible anyway.\n\nHe didn’t have money for meals at the mall or the latest phone. He couldn’t afford fashionable sneakers or jeans; Kristin shopped at Goodwill. When Mr. Needham bought sneakers for Abraham one year, he expected the teenager to pick out the most expensive style. He chose a modest pair.\n\n“He said, ‘Mr. Needham, that is not me,’” the principal remembered. “‘That is not who I am.’”\n\nAbraham was himself with a small, tight group of friends, which included Craig Wigginton, a tall, intense teenager who lived in a small apartment across town. They bonded over their backgrounds. Craig had spent his early childhood on the carnival circuit with his parents, his father, Rick Wigginton, said. His mother eventually left the family. Last year, when his father was sent to prison for a while, Craig was left alone to care for his younger brother. Abraham helped babysit.\n\nAbraham believed Craig was “college professor brilliant.” He sometimes walked eight miles across town to see him. But Craig made Kristin nervous. She was driving him and Abraham somewhere once and a woman in a hijab drove by. She remembers Craig pointing out the “sand monkey in a Cadillac.” He seemed jealous.\n\nMr. Wigginton said his son never used words like that around him. Craig did not respond to requests for comment for this piece.\n\nCraig was the friend Abraham wanted to meet up with the night he asked his mother for the van. Kristin let him take it. It would be four months before she learned what he’d done with it.\n\nThe Power of Ignorance\n\nFort Smith was on the edge of the United States when it appeared in 1817 as a military outpost in Indian Territory, along what is now the Oklahoma-Arkansas border. A federal judge, Isaac Parker, made the place famous in the 1870s by presiding over one of the most prolific courts in the country. Known as the “Hanging Judge,” he sentenced 160 people to death; 79 were executed.\n\nToday, Fort Smith is a mix of the South and the West, a peanut butter cup of libertarian and Southern Baptist sensibilities. The Old South still haunts the place: A monument to the first white child born in Fort Smith, erected in 1936, still stands, barely noticed, in a small park behind a beverage distributorship. Southside High’s Dixie fight song was not retired until 2015, and its Johnny Rebel mascot a year later — and not without a fight.\n\nBut the New South is here, too. Vibrant murals adorn downtown buildings, including a 100-foot-tall painting of an African-American woman and an Apache man on a grain tower. And while the city had a precipitous decline in manufacturing jobs, its economy is now doing other things.\n\nIn February, a Milwaukee-based real estate company bought the old Whirlpool building, where thousands of workers made refrigerators. A large “Available” sign is now stuck to its facade. Health care and transportation companies have been hiring, particularly people with an education. The city’s unemployment rate is lower than the national average, and its population — 88,000 — is up since the last census.\n\nFort Smith may have its country clubs, but the city’s residents are largely middle and lower-middle class. Some homes cost more than $1 million, but a typical home is around $113,000.\n\nNo one knows exactly when the first Muslims immigrated to Fort Smith. Dr. Louay Nassri, a pediatric pulmonologist who is the president of Al Salam Mosque and who came to Fort Smith in 1980, said there was at least one Muslim living here in the early 1970s.\n\nNearly 450 people attended the main Ramadan celebration in June, the closest thing the community has to a census. They are for the most part educated, affluent, integrated. Many are doctors. Others are accountants, business owners, professors and teachers.\n\nHisham remembers when they were just a curiosity.\n\n“Before 9/11, people thought we were Mexican,” he said. “We’d go to Walmart and they’d say, ‘Como está, amigo?’ We were laughing. I said, ‘Excuse me, I don’t speak Spanish.’ They say, ‘Where you from?’ I say Palestine. They say, ‘I never heard about it.’ I say, ‘I think you hear about Israel, right?’ They say yes. I say, ‘That’s my homeland.’”\n\nEach family adapted in its own way.\n\nDr. Hania Al-Shahrouri, a kidney specialist from Jordan, got used to people staring at her head covering. Wearing a hijab in the United States is as much an act of bravery as it is an act of faith, she said. When she first moved to Fort Smith, a man walked up to her in the grocery store.\n\n“In our religion, we don’t hit our women,” he said. “We let them wear whatever they want.”\n\nTall and confident, with the poise of a ballet dancer, Dr. Al-Shahrouri tells herself that people stare because she is pretty, or because they like the color of her hijab. But she worries that her children, including her 13-year-old daughter, may not be able to summon the same self-confidence. So she wields what weapons she has to protect them: her status as a doctor and her wealth. She drives a Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle. She carries an expensive hand bag.\n\nShe doesn’t like herself for it, but she knows that money commands respect, and in some ways, the Muslims who have it are often spared the bigotry that can bedevil those who do not.\n\nMr. Bensalah understands, too. He came to Fort Smith from Morocco in 2000 to attend college. His first job was as a dishwasher. He fell in love with and married a local woman whose family refused to accept him — more because of his skin color, he said, though looking back it was also probably his religion.\n\n“They kept telling her, ‘Why aren’t you marrying your own kind?’” he said. “White women were supposed to marry white men.”\n\nOn Sept. 25, 2001, his wife was in the hospital for the birth of their first child, and several of her relatives stopped him from entering the building. Standing outside, pleading with them to no avail, was one of the worst experiences of his life, he said. He did not witness the birth of his son. Nor did he tell his mother that he had become a father, fearing she would try to visit.\n\n“I saw the power of anger and ignorance,” he said.\n\nDetermined, Mr. Bensalah wore down his in-laws with wit and generosity. He started with the smokers, standing around and cracking jokes. He bought beer. He went hunting. One day he came home from his job as an accountant to find his wife’s cousin on his couch, and they talked for hours. The man became addicted to drugs, and Mr. Bensalah visited him in the hospital after he overdosed. He brought a Bible. As the man recovered, Mr. Bensalah taught him how to budget. He told him that he was worth something. Now the man lives in Colorado with three kids, a wife, and a good job at a mining company.\n\nOut of the worst of America could come the best of America.\n\nThis is what makes Dr. Al-Shahrouri love the United States fiercely: There may be bigotry, but the system is fair, she said. She remembers entering a kidney transplant ward in 2004 with her medical team in San Antonio and being told to leave by the patient’s wife, who raved that Dr. Al-Shahrouri would kill her husband “like they killed us on 9/11.” The doctor in charge warned the woman that if Dr. Al-Shahrouri wasn’t allowed to treat her husband, no one would. Then the entire medical team walked out.\n\nLoyalty, Then Regret\n\nOn the night of Feb. 17, nearly four months after the mosque was vandalized, the police came to Abraham’s house with a warrant for his arrest. Noah thought it was a case of mistaken identity. His brother had been in trouble twice before — once for having pot paraphernalia in his backpack, once for hanging around too late on a playground — but nothing that had required a $15,000 bond.\n\nAbraham wasn’t home, but Noah knew where he was. “Dude, the cops came to arrest you,” he said, driving to pick Abraham up in the minivan so that he could turn himself in. “What’d you do?”\n\nLater, when Abraham really thought about it, he saw so many things that had brought him to this point. Too much Kentucky Deluxe. An inescapable feeling of worthlessness. Unquestioning loyalty to his friends.\n\nCraig lifted Abraham up. He made him feel good about himself. A history buff, Craig liked to use Hitler as an example, Abraham said.\n\n“He said, ‘I understand Hitler did bad things, but on the other side of the coin he is the shining example of why no one can ever say that one man can’t change the world,’” Abraham recounted. “‘He was just one man from a broken country that was being destroyed by its debts, and he turned it into the most formidable fighting force and almost took over the world.’”\n\nAbraham, Craig and another friend, Ezra Pedraza, would sit around in Kristin’s garage, amusing themselves with conspiracy theories and talking about their lives. Ezra went with them on the night of the vandalism.\n\n“He used to tell me and Ezra that we have the power to change the environment around us, too, to do great things and to shape this world,” Abraham said.\n\nAbraham understands how the attack on the mosque looks. The swastikas. The reference to the Crusades. Craig’s father said he was horrified at his son’s use of swastikas. Abraham argued that these were intended not as expressions of racism or white power, but merely as the most offensive images they could conjure — a kind of measure of their manly capacity to shock.\n\nMr. Bensalah said the symbols had their desired effect precisely because they were racist and threatening. Simple insults would not have gotten people’s attention. But swastikas did.\n\n“A swastika is a small act of terrorism if you think about it,” he said. “At that point, yes, it’s scary.”\n\nFor all the regret and penance that the act of vandalism caused Abraham, the decision to commit it took no time at all. The three friends had been drinking and talking about ISIS, he said. Craig was angry about American soldiers being killed, about children dying.\n\nAnd then an impulse: “Let’s retaliate.”\n\nThey got into the white van, and Abraham drove to the mosque on South 28th Street. They went to the other mosque in town that night, too, and drew on it as well.\n\nAbraham burns with regret now. At their ignorance, for lumping all Muslims together. “That’s like meeting one racist, and you say all white guys are like him,” he said.\n\nAt his weakness, for not stopping it: “I wish I could go back in time and say, ‘Hey, dumbass, I’m the future you, and I’m telling you, don’t do this.’”\n\nBut he’d done it. And now he was on his way to jail in the passenger seat of his mom’s white van. Noah drove by the house so Abraham could say goodbye. His mother was sobbing in big, deep gulps. He had felt it before, the dead weight of her disappointment. It made him feel disgusting.\n\n“She cried like a woman who had just got broken,” he said. “I think about that a lot. It’s stuff like that that hurts you while you are in jail. You replay and replay. It’s torture on your mind. Worse than any knife.”\n\n‘I Just Want to Say I’m Sorry’\n\nIf Abraham had $1,580 for a bail bond, he could have waited for his court date at home. But his family couldn’t get the money together. So he waited in jail.\n\nAt the Sebastian County Adult Detention Center, a hulking building with window slits like mail slots, he became the third person in a two-man cell with drafty concrete floors and two metal beds sticking out of the wall.\n\nAbraham was given a sheet and a thin blue sleeping pad, with a pillow area sewn into one end where the stuffing had been torn out. His skinny body was on high alert. He felt cold a lot. He barely slept the first week.\n\nJail reminded him of high school. The prison guards were like the popular kids, lording their power over everybody else. The days were long and boring. People were constantly sizing each other up. New inmates quickly adapted to a rigid social hierarchy.\n\nPretty much every group was represented. He made friends with a black man who was into Japanese cartoons and a Muslim who showed him the Quran. He had never seen one. The man told Abraham not to bother to look for the part where martyrdom brings 72 virgins. “He said it wasn’t there and he knew because he had looked for it himself,” Abraham said, laughing.\n\nThere were white supremacists of several varieties. One took an interest in Abraham after learning that he had vandalized the mosque, even offered him a tattoo. Abraham told Noah later that he had said no.\n\nIt took a month and several upsetting tangles with a confusing appointment system for Kristin to arrange her first visit with Abraham in jail. When she finally saw his face behind the glass, she started to cry. He did, too. Recounting this scene later, he raised his two hands to his cheeks and said, “Two rivers.”\n\nThe telephone for talking through the glass barely worked. They laughed about it. Abraham’s mouth moved, but the sound came out delayed, or not at all, like an old kung fu movie. Kristin and Noah visited every Saturday after that.\n\nAbraham had spent his entire life trying to become strong enough to protect his family, but it was not until jail, he said, that he realized that he was the one who had inflicted the most hurt. He felt a powerful urge to set things right.\n\nThe letter to the mosque, he said, was a first step.\n\n“I was just so tired of doing the wrong thing,” he said.\n\nHe was terrified of going to prison. But his fate was out of his hands. And, anyway, the truth was out: The mosque’s security camera had captured the act.\n\nAbraham did not know the mosque’s address, so he mailed it to his mother, with a small note asking her to deliver it. The postmark was Feb. 22.\n\n“Dear Masjid Al Salam Mosque,” Abraham wrote. “I know you guys probably don’t want to hear from me at all but I really want to get this to y’all. I’m so sorry about having a hand in vandalising your mosque. It was wrong and y’all did not deserve to have that done to you. I hurt y’all and I am haunted by it. And even after all this you still forgave me. You are much better people than I.\n\n“I don’t know what’s going to happen to me, and that is honestly really scary. But I just wouldn’t want to keep going on without trying to make amends. I wish I could undo the pain I helped to cause. I used to walk by your mosque a lot and ask myself why I would do that. I don’t even hate Muslims. Or anyone for that matter.\n\n“All in all,” he concluded, “I just want to say I’m sorry.”\n\nNoah drove the letter to the mosque on a Friday. He took off his shoes as a sign of respect and introduced himself. Dr. Nassri was moved. No one had expected to hear from the vandals. Certainly not like this.\n\nDr. Nassri called a meeting of senior members of the mosque. Hisham was there. So was Mr. Bensalah, the accountant from Morocco.\n\nThe sermon had just reminded them of their duty as Muslims to forgive. It didn’t take them long to do it.\n\n“If one of my kids did something stupid like that I would want them to be forgiven,” Mr. Bensalah said.\n\nLater, when Dr. Nassri met with a man from the prosecutor’s office, he made clear that the mosque did not want to press charges and strongly opposed a felony charge for Abraham.\n\n“We did not want this to destroy his life,” Dr. Nassri said.\n\nUrging Mercy\n\nThe long wooden benches in the gallery of Courtroom 201 were already packed on May 24, the day of Abraham’s hearing. Nearly everyone was white. Most of the defendants were poor.\n\nThe morning unfolded in a relentless stream of misery over crimes like drug possession and writing bad checks.\n\nKristin and Noah walked in at 9 a.m. sharp. Noah, in his best jeans and plaid shirt, sat with his chin in his hands. Kristin kept nervously shifting in her seat. Hisham walked in, wearing jeans and an electric-lime shirt. He wedged himself in next to Kristin, but had no idea who she was.\n\nAbraham’s case had taken an unexpected turn.\n\nDr. Nassri had gone to meet the prosecutors again. They had bad news: Abraham would have to plead guilty to a felony, not a mere misdemeanor, or face a trial. He would avoid prison, but only if he remained on good behavior for three years. Any minor violation could land him behind bars for six years. The best outcome he could hope for would be to get a judge to seal his record — in eight years.\n\nDr. Nassri was taken aback. “I said, ‘You guys are asking for more than we want,’” he said. “They call us the victims, and the victims say, ‘Hey, guys, loosen up!’”\n\nBut the prosecutors were unmoved. Daniel Shue, the head prosecuting attorney, said that actions had consequences and that all three men had participated. And this was not just a run-of-the-mill vandalism, it was an act of bigotry.\n\nThe mosque’s camera had captured Craig in the act of writing, and his punishment was steepest. The prosecutor said that there was no clear proof that either of the other two had done any writing but that no one could know without a trial.\n\nThe law was straightforward: If the spray painting and other vandalism cost the mosque more than $1,000 to repair, the case was a felony. Anything equal or less than that was a misdemeanor. Dr. Nassri submitted paperwork showing the mosque had spent only $500 on cleanup. But the prosecutor’s office sought its own estimate from a local restoration company, which claimed the damage would cost about $1,800 to clean up.\n\nAbraham’s public defender told him that they could attack that evidence at trial. But Abraham wanted to get out of jail.\n\nAround 11:15 a.m., he shuffled into the courtroom through a side door in an orange jump suit and leg irons. Craig was with him. Ezra Pedraza, who had been out on bail, wore a plaid shirt and jeans.\n\nThe prosecutor noted that the victims “asked for mercy and leniency.”\n\nThe judge looked out at the defendants. “Mercy. Hmmm.”\n\nHe accepted their pleas. Then he lectured them.\n\n“If the victims in this case had not approved of this, I would not have done it,” he said. “You would have gone to trial, and there is a good chance all three of you would have gone to prison. So you need to think twice before you do something, which is just stupid. What you did was just stupid.”\n\nKristin, losing patience, said under her breath: “Thank you. Point taken.”\n\nHard-Won Second Chances\n\nIt is summer in Fort Smith. The sun is searing. On Hisham’s car lot, small fruit trees and vegetables grow in dirt-filled kiddie swimming pools. He is already harvesting figs and hot peppers, as well as Syrian thyme and mint that he uses to flavor his visitors’ tea.\n\nHisham believes the vandalism of his mosque was one of the best things to happen to the Muslims of Fort Smith. The crime allowed them to reveal themselves — to say, “We are your doctors, your accountants and your used-car salesmen.” They now have a relationship with the synagogue in town. Several members, including Dr. Al-Shahrouri, the kidney specialist, have begun speaking to local audiences about Islam.\n\nHisham was reminded of a saying from the Quran.\n\n“You might hate something that happens to you, but actually it’s excellent for you,” he said, sitting in his small, cluttered shop, surrounded by artifacts of his life: a revolving display of birthday key chains, a giant dried bean pod the size of an arm, an Elvis belt buckle and two plaques he got in the mail after he donated to a Sept. 11 fund. “That’s what happened to us: Something very bad. But very good result.”\n\nBut Hisham also doesn’t like how hard it is to get a second chance in America. You can do a stupid thing and pay for it, but afterward no one will hire you. Hisham has helped two men in this situation. They do odd jobs at his car lot. He went to court with them when no one else would. He helped one buy a washing machine, and paid for the other to bury a relative.\n\n“Someone messes up and it sticks with him all his life,” Hisham said. “Even if he tries to become a good man, the community say to him, ‘You are a bad man!’ They encourage him to be a bad man.”\n\nFor Abraham, jail became a dividing line between the mistakes of his past and some unknown future.\n\nWhen Noah first saw his brother after he was released, Abraham was standing alone outside the jail, holding an envelope and a Bible. Noah parked the car and jumped out without shutting his door, sprinting across the street to embrace him.\n\nBack at home, Abraham’s family gathered around him in the driveway, laughing and talking. The night was warm, and the stars were out. Gabriel was ecstatic, hopping up and down.\n\n“I’m overwhelmed,” Abraham said, looking at the sky.\n\nKristin wanted to sing a song with her son: “Find Your Wings,” by the Christian singer Mark Harris. They sang, haltingly and softly, in harmony:\n\nI pray that God would fill your heart with dreams.\n\nAnd that faith gives you the courage to dare to do great things.\n\nI’m here for you whatever this life brings.\n\nSo let my love give you roots. And help you find your wings.\n\n“That’s my boy,” Kristin said, beaming at Abraham. “That’s my baby boy.”\n\nBut he was now a felon, and there were daily reminders of that. A police car regularly circled their block. He had community service to perform, and within a few days he was sorting donations at a Goodwill store.\n\nHe owed about $3,200 in fines and restitution, but landing a job would be harder now. Kristin found about 20 employers in Fort Smith that hired felons. Abraham wanted to fill out paper applications but was told to apply online. He did not have a computer, which meant he had to go to the library whenever he needed one.\n\nHis family’s finances had not improved while he was away. The day he started at Goodwill, the water was cut off at the house and the phone was about to be disconnected.\n\nHe felt embarrassed to tell people what he had done, like the manager at Goodwill, who recognized Abraham from when he used to come in as a boy. But he would feel better afterward, as if confessing was helping him grow some stub of a new self.\n\nIt was a daily struggle. “I wake up and look in the mirror and I just think, ‘Who are you?’” Abraham said.\n\nHe wanted badly to visit the mosque, to say hello and thank the people there. Dr. Nassri had asked the prosecutor to allow Abraham to come, but was told no. Mr. Bensalah suggested meeting Abraham in a cafe, but the public defender advised against it.\n\nAfter he got out of jail, Abraham posted a note on Facebook.\n\n“Well, I’m home now,” he wrote. “I just want to say thank you to all those who have been supporting me and a big thanks to the guys at the mosque who have been supportive and helpful and I pray blessings over them.”\n\nThe next day, he saw a response from Wasim, Hisham’s son.\n\n“Bro move on with life we forgave you from the first time you apologized don’t let that mistake bring you down,” he had written. And then, Abraham’s favorite line: “I speak for the whole Muslim community of fort smith we love you and want you to be the best example in life we don’t hold grudges against anybody!”\n\nIt was the nicest thing anyone had ever said to him.","author":"","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T11:00:01.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/21/us/fort-smith-slide-3A1J/fort-smith-slide-3A1J-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg","digest":"XImvi1CmkjMlsfSPM+Gw2A==\n"}

Here, a Rockport home remains surrounded by flood waters on Saturday. Photo: Eric Gay/Associated Press\n\nWireless networks along the Texas coast suffered outages as a result of Hurricane Harvey, federal regulators said, leaving customers in some counties with limited or no cellphone service.\n\nRockport, Texas, near where the hurricane made landfall, was the hardest hit, according to the Federal Communications Commission. About 95% of cell sites there aren’t working, the agency said Sunday, meaning cellphone users relying on the sites can’t send or receive phone calls or data.\n\nOf the 7,804 cell sites across the region, 320 are out of service, or about 4%. The hardest-hit areas are Aransas County, Refugio County, Calhoun County and San Patricio County.\n\nThose counties were subject to mandatory evacuation orders, so it was unclear how many people are affected by the outages. It was also unclear which carriers stayed online and which went down, because carriers aren’t required to disclose the information publicly.\n\nWhen cell towers stop working, customers can’t access the web, send calls or texts from their cellphones unless they have Wi-Fi from their cable or wireline telecom company. If only a few towers go down, service might get slower as more people connect to the remaining towers.\n\nAt least 148,565 people in the path of the hurricane were without cable or wireline service on Sunday, the FCC said.\n\nMost cell towers have backup batteries that can last up to eight hours, and fuel generators that can take over after that. But they can still go down if they get flooded or if equipment gets blown off the tower, carriers say.\n\nThis image shows the percentage of cell sites that were out of service by county as of Sunday morning. Photo: Federal Communications Commission\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. said it sent in extra crews to Texas and topped off fuel in each tower’s backup generators in the days leading up to the storm.\n\n“Verizon’s network continues to perform well throughout the storm’s impacted area,” the carrier wrote in an email. “As anticipated, commercial power is out in many places throughout Texas, but backup generators are running and refueling vendors are on standby to ensure facilities continue operating.”\n\nVerizon is offering free service to monthly subscribers in the affected area until Sept. 8.\n\nA Sprint Corp. spokeswoman said “a relatively small number of cell sites are impacted due to commercial power outages but overall the network is holding up well.” Sprint is giving free unlimited service until Sept. 1.\n\nA T-Mobile spokeswoman said about half of its Corpus Christi market, which includes Rockport, had some level of service degradation, a less disruptive impact than the fallout from other recent storms, including Hurricane Matthew last year.\n\nHurricane Harvey barreled into Texas on Friday night leaving damage in its wake.

Photo: NASA\n\nShe said impassable roads were keeping crews from responding to damaged cell towers but fewer than 50 locations were affected. T-Mobile also offered free calling and texting for customers in the affected areas and those trying to reach them.\n\nSome crews were ready to roll out new generators and equipment on Saturday but were waiting for the storm to subside before moving, she said. “Keep in mind that Harvey is still really young,” she said Saturday. “We don’t know what’s going to happen over the next week.”\n\nAn AT\u0026T spokesman said the company’s networks in South Texas were performing well so far. “Our technicians are working to restore service to affected areas as quickly and safely as conditions allow,” he said.\n\nCarriers recommend people keep cellphones and backup batteries charged and use text messages instead of voice calls to reduce network congestion. Landline telephones that use copper will work during power outages, but landlines that rely on new technology, known as IP, won’t.\n\n—Drew FitzGerald contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Ryan Knutson at ryan.knutson@wsj.com\n\nAppeared in the August 28, 2017, print edition.","author":"Ryan Knutson","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-27T00:03:00.000Z"},"source":"the-wall-street-journal","urlToImage":"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-UV511_3cgAb_TOP_20170826195044.jpg","digest":"iY+CYemQO0U2TvGBAuOAWw==\n"}

While many residents fled inland to hotels and shelters, some stayed—out of necessity, fear of looters or sheer stubbornness.

If they were killed Friday night, at least someone would be able to identify them.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Rinche, his tool belt dangling from his hip like a holster, walked through the torn-up streets, eyeing mangled homes, and chatting with other locals to get the latest updates on which house got hit and how bad.\n\n“There’s going to be a lot of chain saw work,” the 32-year-old said. “If you got tools, use ‘em. If you’re breathing, you can work. This is Rockport. We’ll be fine.”\n\nEmergency workers are trying to help those stranded in flooded areas of Texas as rain from what remains of Hurricane Harvey continues to batter the coast. Drone footage shows the extent of the damage across communities. Photo: AP\n\nUp and down the central coast of Texas, a string of small cities and beach towns remained unnervingly populated as Hurricane Harvey bore down. Many thousands had obeyed evacuation orders and fled inland to hotels and shelters; meanwhile, some had stayed—out of necessity, fear of looters or sheer stubbornness.\n\nOthers who chose to ride out the storm were older residents, their memories hardened by past storms they had endured.\n\nSo far, local officials said they knew of one person killed in the storm in Rockport, the small fishing and resort community devastated by Hurricane Harvey. There, the storm tangled power lines and felled hulking oaks that now cluttered the streets. Roofs, garage doors and even entire homes were crumpled by Harvey’s power. The air was heavy with the odor of leaking gas.\n\nAs the storm pressed north, those who remained on the coast emerged to take stock of the damage, count their blessings and face the next challenge: the aftermath.\n\n“We lost what we had,” said Juan Hernandez, who stayed in his Aransas Pass, Texas, home with his family. They sat in the dark, watching as the storm took their fence line. Then they noticed the leaks in their roof.\n\n“That’s when everything started caving in,” said Mr. Hernandez, a 65-year-old pipe fitter. “We’ve got one room good: that’s the kitchen.”\n\nMr. Hernandez said his family has food, but he was hoping help would arrive soon.\n\n“We survived,” he said, searching for a cellphone signal in the parking lot of a damaged Wal-Mart . “At least nobody got hurt.”\n\nThe flashing red “Open” sign paired with the handwritten message posted on a boarded window—“HOT COFFEE”— was a beacon in the dark, broken disaster zone of this Rockport neighborhood.\n\nMatthew Otero posted the message Saturday morning when he opened Rockport Donuts, the business he and his wife have run for nearly six years.\n\n“My first thing was, ‘thank God the building survived,’ ” he said as he served the occasional customer the promised hot coffee as well as kolaches hand-rolled by his wife and mother-in-law.\n\nOutside, in areas where water hadn’t pooled, debris had: downed poles and power lines, pieces of buildings and broken trees. Inside the shop, a generator whirred, keeping it powered. Amid the tables and chairs, a small orange inflatable boat caught dripping water from a leak in the roof caused by the storm.\n\n“What can you do, you gotta wipe off your knees and keep going,” Mr. Otero said. He surveyed the shop with red-rimmed eyes. He said he would be putting off plans to expand after the storm damaged a separate commercial building he owns.\n\n“You’re set back, you know,” he said, his voice shaky. “I’m fortunate. There are people who have lost their homes.”\n\nMr. Otero said he weathered Hurricane Harvey at the local Holiday Inn , keeping in touch with his wife, who was in Dallas before heading to Paris, Texas, to stay with her sister, and family members in New Mexico until about midnight, when he no longer had phone or internet service. He said he felt safe—until the eye of the storm was nearly upon Rockport.\n\n“That wind,” he said, as he recalled how it shook the hotel. “You could see roofs coming off. You could see big palm trees bending. You could see big garbage bins rolling down the street.”\n\nOn Saturday morning, he found his house intact, but the tree house his four daughters loved to play in was gone. He headed to his shop next and, by 9 a.m., he was open for business.\n\n“I knew coffee was going to be important,” he said from behind the doughnut case, which stood empty. “My goal is to get everybody hot coffee,” he said.\n\nMr. Otero worries about how quickly Rockport, a community whose economy is reliant on vacationers, will recover. “It’s going to be a while before they come back,” he said, even as more locals wandered through the door in rubber boots and raincoats.\n\n“Unbelievable; we got word you were open,” said a woman who had stuck it out through the storm. But she had the same vow as several others who had come in: “Never again.”\n\nMickey Casterline, 70, also rode out the storm at his friend Raymond Owens ’ home in neighboring Fulton, Texas. The two of them said they never gave evacuating a second thought.\n\nMr. Casterline, who serves as a commissioner for the Aransas County Navigation District, which helps manage natural resources in the area, said his family had lived in the coastal town of Fulton since the 1820s.\n\nThe two Texas old-timers surveyed Mr. Casterline’s white, wooden home just a few blocks from the water. So far, there didn’t seem to be any real damage, save for the shutters that were ripped from their hinges and now lay useless in the front yard. Mr. Casterline said his house was made of timber, not plywood, and he guessed that helped it weather the winds.\n\nMr. Owens, who had bought his land here in 1975, said that the giant, age-old oak trees that have towered over the streets and homes for generations absorbed Harvey’s winds, blunting the force of the gusts before they could do more harm. He surmised those same trees had shielded them both last night when the storm roared toward them.\n\nOne massive oak tree laid upturned next to Mr. Casterline’s home, its branches thrusting upward.\n\n“This is the first time I’ve ever seen these oak tress like this. Ever.” Mr. Casterline said. “There’s no telling what we lost in oak trees.”\n\nAs the rain pelted him, Mr. Casterline poured himself a drink he called a “Mickey Mary”: tequila, salsa verde, Worcestershire sauce, lime and Clamato.\n\n“A salute,” he said, hopefully. “To the end of Harvey.”\n\nMr. Rinche, the local home builder, grew up in Rockport and had decided to hunker down during Harvey with his wife, her parents and several other couples in a three-story house he had helped build.\n\nThe owners were away in Mexico and had asked him to secure the house with storm shutters when they also offered to let him stay.\n\nWith his own home already boarded up, Mr. Rinche decided to take them up on it. Besides, he said there was simply too much traffic to leave Rockport, and he was short money to stay at a hotel and buy gas.\n\n“Right when the eye hit, we came outside, smoked a couple of cigarettes and drank a couple of beers,” he said, with a chuckle. “It was insane. But we’re Texans. We were born here.”\n\nWrite to Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.com and Erin Ailworth at Erin.Ailworth@wsj.com","author":"Dan Frosch","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-27T01:25:00.000Z"},"source":"the-wall-street-journal","urlToImage":"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-UV513_3cgQd_TOP_20170826205355.jpg","digest":"brUJt59GvEN0op+ATY8t/g==\n"}

Rescuers answered hundreds of calls for help as floodwaters from the remnants of Hurricane Harvey began to fill second-story homes. Mark Mulligan/AP\n\nThe hurricane, which has weakened to a tropical storm, is the first Category 4 storm to hit the United States since Charley in 2004. Harvey has destroyed homes, severed power supplies and caused severe flooding.\n\nThe hurricane, which has weakened to a tropical storm, roared ashore at 10 p.m. Friday with 130 mph winds — the first Category 4 storm to hit the United States since Charley in 2004.\n\nThe hurricane, which has weakened to a tropical storm, roared ashore at 10 p.m. Friday with 130 mph winds — the first Category 4 storm to hit the United States since Charley in 2004.\n\nThe wind was so intense here that Cathy Dever thought it was a tornado — one that never seemed to end.\n\nDever fled her double-wide trailer and sought refuge in her neighbor’s utility closet, clutching a small plastic bag that contained her son’s phone number. If she didn’t survive, she thought, at least she would be quickly identified.\n\nFor hours she waited, flinching each time gravel and debris slammed against the storm shutters.\n\n“It was so loud, you could hear it picking up rocks off the landscape,” Dever, 59, said Saturday, just after Hurricane Harvey made landfall over this spit of land 30 miles northeast of Corpus Christi.\n\nAs residents emerged throughout the morning, local officials and emergency responders across the region scrambled to assess the damage.\n\nHurricane Harvey hit the Texas coast on Aug. 25 with extreme rain and 130 mph winds, and residents are bracing for more bad weather. (Victoria Walker,Whitney Leaming,Kurt Kuykendall/The Washington Post)\n\nAccording to initial assessments, Corpus Christi was relatively spared a devastating impact, although half of the city lost electricity and roofs were blown off some buildings.\n\nBut in Rockport, as well as in the adjoining towns of Fulton and Aransas Pass, there were scores of damaged or destroyed properties across communities of mobile homes, middle-class houses and vacation retreats. The Category 4 hurricane tossed the mobile homes across streets and into neighboring structures, chewed through brick buildings and peeled off roofs and aluminum siding.\n\nAt the entrance to the resort town of Port Aransas on Mustang Island, law enforcement blocked the road. Power poles dipped tipsily over roads and electric lines lay deep in fast-moving water.\n\n“It is too dangerous,” one Port Aransas police officer said. “The roads are collapsing, and there are downed power lines everywhere.”\n\nOfficers began conducting a search-and-rescue operation for eight people reported missing, according to an Aransas County sheriff’s deputy. “There is no cellphone service and no electricity, so we don’t know how many people are actually in danger and how many people just can’t get through.”\n\nLate Saturday afternoon, police started forcing evacuations of residents and tourists who had decided to stay on the island despite mandatory orders to leave, saying it was too dangerous for anyone to remain.\n\nIn Rockport, a town of about 10,000 residents, numerous buildings had collapsed, including several iconic structures in the beachy commercial district.\n\nThe wind shredded restaurants as well as antique, jewelry and book stores — sometimes randomly. On one street, the Quick \u0026 Save store had its roof blown off while the nearby Mac’s Pit Barbecue appeared largely intact.\n\nStrip malls and hotels also suffered major damage. At the waterfront hotel Hunt’s Castle, the roof was peeled off and most windows were broken. A Washington Post videographer discovered a woman in a ground-floor room, where she was stocked with packs of cigarettes but no food. She refused to identify herself.\n\nYet the town and broader area appeared to escape the kind of catastrophic damage that Hurricane Katrina, which made landfall as a Category 3 storm, inflicted on the upper Gulf Coast in 2005. Despite predictions of a 6- to 12-foot storm surge, residents and emergency management officials here say that amount of water never materialized.\n\n“I expected a lot worse,” Dustin Wright, who lives four blocks from the coast and only suffered minor roof damage, said when he returned home Saturday after an overnight evacuation. “It’s a mess, but from what I can tell, the storm surge didn’t even make it to me.”\n\nWhat the hurricane lacked in water, though, it made up for in wind. The National Weather Service reported gusts as high as 132 mph at Port Aransas on Friday night.\n\nLong before the eyewall passed over the area, the wind sucked the windows out of nearly a dozen Aransas County Sheriff Department’s vehicles.\n\nJimmy Kendrick, the mayor of Fulton, said he and several emergency management officials used an armored SWAT vehicle to try to escape from the wind. He thinks numerous “mini-tornadoes” passed over the peninsula as Harvey’s eye came ashore.\n\n“You couldn’t even see the hand in front of your face” in the wind-driven rain, said Kendrick, who lost the Sears appliance store he owns. Two school gymnasiums also were destroyed, he said. “You just look around and see things are totally gone.”\n\nPhone, electric and gas service have been crippled throughout the area, and local officials on Saturday were raiding damaged school cafeterias to try to feed emergency workers.\n\nEven in Corpus Christi, which was under a voluntary evacuation and suffered much less damage, unprepared residents struggled Saturday to find gas and food because stores were closed because of no electricity.\n\nKendrick said it may be weeks before Fulton’s evacuees can safely return. Those who refused to evacuate despite a mandatory order — about 1,000 of the town’s 2,000 residents — will face days of intense suffering until relief supplies arrive, he predicted.

(John Moore)\n\nAs Joseph Arpaio’s federal case headed toward trial this past spring, President Trump wanted to act to help the former Arizona county sheriff who had become a campaign-trail companion and a partner in their crusade against illegal immigration.\n\nThe president asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions whether it would be possible for the government to drop the criminal case against Arpaio, but was advised that would be inappropriate, according to three people with knowledge of the conversation.\n\nAfter talking with Sessions, Trump decided to let the case go to trial, and if Arpaio was convicted, he could grant clemency.\n\nSo the president waited, all the while planning to issue a pardon if Arpaio was found in contempt of court for defying a federal judge’s order to stop detaining people merely because he suspected them of being undocumented immigrants. Trump was, in the words of one associate, “gung-ho about it.”\n\n“We knew the president wanted to do this for some time now and had worked to prepare for whenever the moment may come,” said one White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the action.\n\nPresident Trump pardoned former Maricopa County, Ariz., sheriff Joe Arpaio Aug. 25. Here’s what you need to know. (Patrick Martin,Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nResponding to questions about Trump’s conversation with Sessions, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, “It’s only natural the president would have a discussion with administration lawyers about legal matters. This case would be no different.”\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nTrump’s Friday-evening decision to issue his first pardon for Arpaio was the culmination of a five-year political friendship with roots in the “birther” movement to undermine President Barack Obama. In an extraordinary exercise of presidential power, Trump bypassed the traditional review process to ensure that Arpaio, who was convicted of contempt of court, would face no time in prison.\n\n[Read Trump’s pardon of former Arizona county sheriff Arpaio]\n\nTrump’s pardon, issued without consulting the Justice Department, raised a storm of protest over the weekend, including from some fellow Republicans, and threatens to become a stain on the president’s legacy. His effort to see if the case could be dropped showed a troubling disregard for the traditional wall between the White House and the Justice Department, and taken together with similar actions could undermine respect for the rule of law, experts said.\n\nArpaio faced up to six months in prison and was due to be sentenced in October. During his 23 years as Maricopa County sheriff, Arpaio was a lightning rod, in part because of his aggressive crackdown on illegal immigrants. He also was accused of racial profiling, failure to investigate sex crimes, poor treatment of prisoners and other instances of police misconduct.\n\nTo Trump, however, Arpaio is an American hero — a man who enlisted in the military at 18 after the outbreak of the Korean War, worked as a beat cop in Washington and Las Vegas and as a special agent investigating drug crimes around the world, then was elected sheriff in the epicenter of the nation’s roiling immigration debate.\n\nJoe Arpaio's illegal-immigration crackdown made him a polarizing figure and an early ally of President Trump. (Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nArpaio’s age weighed on Trump, some of his confidants said. The 71-year-old president could not stomach seeing an 85-year-old he admired as a law-and-order icon wasting away in a jail cell.\n\nTrump’s spring inquiry about intervening in Arpaio’s case is consistent with his alleged attempts to influence the federal investigation of Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser. Trump also made separate appeals in March to Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats and National Security Agency Director Michael S. Rogers to publicly deny the existence of any evidence of collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\n[Trump pardons former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio]\n\nTrump’s pardon of Arpaio “was his backhand way of doing what he wanted to do at the front end,” said Robert Bauer, a former White House counsel in the Obama administration. “He just wanted to kill the prosecution off. He couldn’t do it the one way, so he ended up doing it the other way. This is just another vivid demonstration of how far removed from an appropriate exercise of the pardon power this was.”\n\nPresidents can set law enforcement priorities, but they are expected to steer clear of involvement in specific cases to avoid the perception of politicizing the impartial administration of justice.\n\nTrump backed off the Arpaio case after being advised it would be inappropriate, but that he even tried is “beyond the pale,” said Chiraag Bains, a former senior counsel in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.\n\nBains said he believes Trump “has a sense that the chief executive controls everything in the executive branch, including the exercise of criminal power. And that is just not the way the system is set up.”​\n\nTrump and Arpaio became brothers in arms five years ago. As they saw it, the two provocateurs — one a celebrity real estate developer, the other a polarizing sheriff — were pursuing justice in the form of supposed evidence that Obama’s birth certificate was fraudulent.\n\nAs caretakers of the false “birther” conspiracy, Trump and Arpaio relentlessly probed Obama’s birth in Hawaii and nurtured a lie to damage the legitimacy of the nation’s first African American president.\n\n“There was no collusion,” Arpaio said in an interview Saturday. “I started my birth certificate investigation around the same time he did his.”\n\n[Trump admits Obama was born in U.S. but falsely blames Clinton for rumors]\n\nThe Manhattan mogul sent Arpaio a fan letter and flattered him on social media. “Congratulations to @RealSheriffJoe on his successful Cold Case Posse investigation which claims @BarackObama’s ‘birth certificate’ is fake,” Trump tweeted in 2012.\n\nThree years later, in July 2015, when Trump swooped into Arpaio’s hometown of Phoenix for the first mega-rally of his upstart presidential campaign, the sheriff returned the favor by testifying on stage to “the silent majority” that Trump had begun to awaken.\n\nBackstage at that rally, Arpaio recalled, the two men talked about their shared birthday — June 14, which is Flag Day. Their friendship blossomed and Arpaio became a fan favorite at Trump rallies. “I had a gut feeling that he was going to win,” Arpaio said.\n\nEven as Trump went on to win last November, however, Arpaio lost his reelection — and that was the least of his troubles.\n\nFederal prosecutors filed criminal charges against Arpaio last October. Trump was paying attention to the case and he called Arpaio to check in on him around Thanksgiving, according to the former sheriff. That’s when Arpaio told the president-elect that his wife, Ava, had cancer.\n\nOn July 31, Arpaio was convicted by a judge, as opposed to a jury. Arpaio and his lawyer, Mark Goldman, said they did not contact Trump during this period, nor ask anyone in the administration for a pardon.\n\n“I didn’t ask for the pardon,” Arpaio said. “He wanted to do it because I think he understood what I was going through.”\n\nInside the West Wing, the pardon process was set in motion. Senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who had gotten to know Arpaio through their work on immigration policy during the campaign, advocated internally for the pardon, as did chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, according to people familiar with the deliberations.\n\nThe White House Counsel’s Office had quietly begun preparing the paperwork and communications staffers had started drawing up talking points when Trump foreshadowed his intentions Aug. 15 by retweeting a Fox News story reporting that the president was “seriously considering” pardoning Arpaio.\n\nAround the same time, Arpaio received a call from the White House Counsel’s Office asking whether he would accept a pardon if one were issued. He told the presidential lawyer that he would, according to Goldman.\n\n[As Trump ranted and rambled in Phoenix, his crowd slowly thinned]\n\nThe drumbeat culminated Tuesday when Trump returned to the Phoenix Convention Center — the site of the July 2015 rally — for a “Make America Great Again” campaign event.\n\nAs Air Force One rumbled toward Arizona, Sanders tried to douse speculation by telling reporters that the president would have “no discussion” and “no action” pertaining to Arpaio at the rally.\n\nArpaio said he was eager to attend the rally and visit with the president backstage, but decided, “I didn’t want to cause any harm or riots, so I stayed away, which really hurt me.”\n\nWhen Arpaio heard Sanders say Trump would not talk about a pardon, he said he turned to his wife and told her, “Don’t believe anything you hear because I know how he is.”\n\nSure enough, Trump bellowed from the stage, “I’m just curious: Do the people in this room like Sheriff Joe?”\n\nThe crowd burst into applause.\n\n“Was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?” Trump asked.\n\nMore applause.\n\n“He should have had a jury, but you know what? I’ll make a prediction,” the president said. “I won’t do it tonight, because I don’t want to cause any controversy. . . But Sheriff Joe can feel good.”\n\nArpaio and his legal team did not feel very good the next night, when they read a CBS News report that Trump was being advised not to pardon Arpaio until after his sentencing.\n\nGoldman wrote a two-page letter to White House Counsel Donald F. McGahn II, sent on Friday morning, saying, “Hopefully this is more fake news,” and telling McGahn that a delay until after sentencing “would place Sheriff Arpaio in an untenable and unprecedented position.”\n\n[Read a letter from Arpaio’s lawyer to White House Counsel McGahn]\n\nWithout a pardon, Goldman said, Arpaio could be “sentenced, handcuffed, given a ‘perp walk’ and incarcerated” and “left to languish in federal custody.”\n\nMcGahn did not immediately reply, but a few hours later, at about 6:30 p.m. D.C. time, another lawyer in his office called Goldman’s co-counsel to double-check that Arpaio would accept a pardon. A few minutes later, an email arrived from the White House with a single page attachment: an “Executive Grant of Clemency” for Arpaio signed by Trump in his thick, black script, complete with a golden Justice Department seal.\n\nGoldman printed out three copies of the document and drove out to Arpaio’s home in Fountain Hills, a suburb of Phoenix, where the former sheriff was getting ready to take his wife to dinner at Arrivederci, an Italian restaurant, to celebrate Ava’s 86th birthday.\n\n“Of course, his first question was, ‘Is this a fake document?’ ” Goldman recalled. “We know the sheriff has looked into fake documents.”\n\nThe Arpaios still went out for their spaghetti dinner. As of Saturday, Arpaio had not heard from Trump personally, but said if the president were to call he would advise him to take a lesson from his Arizona adventures.\n\n“If they can do it to me, they can do it to anybody, including the president of the United States,” Arpaio said. Alluding to the Russia probe, he said, “He’s been under a lot of fire right now, him and his family, and I’ve been through the fire quite a while.”","author":"Philip Rucker, Ellen Nakashima, Philip Rucker, Ellen Nakashima","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T11:45:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/26/National-Politics/Images/578541700.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"SazbAcXF5c4YoffAoBDV+w==\n"}

Here's what you need to know. (Patrick Martin,Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nOn Friday night, as Hurricane Harvey was bearing down on the Texas coast, President Trump pardoned Joe Arpiao. The former Arizona sheriff had been convicted of criminal contempt for ignoring a judge's orders to stop detaining people simply because he suspected them of being undocumented immigrants. (Over his decade-long career, his Maricopa County department was also accused of abusing prisoners, subjecting inmates to inhumane punishment and of ignoring other important crimes to track and expel immigrants.)\n\nIt's a controversial decision, one that Trump critics labeled as an example of the president's illiberal, rule-of-law violating, authoritarian impulses.\n\nNew York magazine called it, “Donald Trump’s gravest abuse of power yet.” An op-ed contributor for the New York Times said that Trump's decision put him in “uncharted waters,” writing \" if the president can employ the pardon power to circumvent constitutional protections of liberty, there is very little left of the constitutional checks on presidential power.” Bob Bauer, a former White House counsel in the Obama administration, suggested on Lawfare that the decision showed a clear disregard for the rule of law.\n\nEven before Trump granted the pardon, Noah Feldman, a law professor at Harvard, argued that such a move “would express presidential contempt for the Constitution.”\n\nHow valid are these concerns? We surveyed a handful of professors who study authoritarianism in other countries on what they see in Trump's decision, and whether it makes them nervous:\n\nRuth Ben-Ghiat, a New York University professor who studies authoritarian rulers, propaganda and fascism and its memory:\n\n“In situations where democracies become right-wing regimes, the leader usually relies on paramilitary or other extremist forces to get into office or consolidate power once he's there. He has to dance the line between expelling them and using them. Trump's expulsion of Stephen Bannon and Seb Gorka, coming together with his open support of white nationalism and now his pardon of Joe Arpaio, shows this dynamic well.\n\n“If the leader does not explicitly renounce the violent rhetoric and actions of extremists, they will have done their damage even if he later purges them. The result is a new culture of violence in the country, which the other armed and security forces of society must adapt to.”\n\nTom Pepinsky, who studies interaction of political and economic systems in emerging market economies at Cornell University:\n\n“Authoritarians generally don't allow their officials to be convicted of anything in the first place. So it's a sign of how much the president is working against the system that produces outcomes that he doesn't like one bit.\n\n“Now, I think it is meaningful that Arpaio is a law enforcement official, but that's because it reveals the hollowness of 'law and order' presidency. What I'd really find more troubling is if he starts pardoning your everyday police officers who are convicted of the abuse of power or other violent crimes.”\n\nCas Mudde, a University of Georgia professor who studies political extremism and populism in Europe:\n\n“In real autocracies, dictators don't have to pardon people, because they would never get sentenced! In other words, this is, at best, a sign of an illiberal democrat caught up in a liberal democratic system.\n\n“The most contentious, and remarkable, part of the pardon is not the person pardoned — 'Sheriff' Arpaio is a hero to the Trump base and therefore makes a perfect candidate (it's often heroes of the base or donors of the party/president) — but the timing of the pardoning. First of all, it is very early in the presidency and, second, it is before Arpaio has been sentenced. I think the latter is a clear reflection of President Trump's complete disregard for the rule of law. He believes in the rule of power, in part because he has experienced throughout his lifetime that this is how U.S. justice works. However, the timing is probably, as several others have also noted, more linked to the issue that predominates President Trump's mind: the Russia investigation. There are several key people in his former entourage who are at the point of caving to pressure to working with the [Robert S.] Mueller investigation. Trump has shown them that they have nothing to fear, because he can and will pardon them, irrespective of the circumstances. This, of course, is a fundamentally undemocratic position, but not so much informed by ideology but by naked self-interest.”\n\nSherri Berman, a European history professor at Barnard\n\n“Pardoning itself is not a particularly authoritarian policy, as you know. All presidents have this right, but how they use it often signals their priorities or at least personal preferences. (President Barack Obama, for example, made a big show of pardoning nonviolent drug offenders.) So I would treat Arpaio's pardoning as a political and in particular a signaling move on Trump's part — and a smart one. I think Trump has been very good at this — he hasn't been able to get many things through Congress, but he has 'compensated' with exec orders and symbolic politics that have, for the most part, kept his base attached.”","author":"Amanda Erickson, Amanda Erickson","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-26T09:42:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2017/08/Arpaio-Pardon_59197-30920.jpg\u0026w=1484\u0026op=resize\u0026opt=1\u0026filter=antialias\u0026t=20170517","digest":"mJKaWCnCuTkVV/aAtMIrQw==\n"}

But many people suspect the inaction was deliberate, because just a month earlier, the police were heavily criticized for responding harshly at a Ku Klux Klan rally where anti-Klan protesters were sprayed with tear gas and arrested.\n\nOn the day of the “Unite the Right” rally, Aug. 12, only eight arrests were made, even with 125 local officers, hundreds of National Guard troops, the state police and neighboring police agencies present. Those arrested included James A. Fields, the driver who has been charged with murder in the death of Heather D. Heyer.\n\nInvestigators are also close to making arrests in the case of DeAndre Harris, 20, a local teacher’s aide and African-American who was beaten with a metal pipe and slabs of wood in a parking garage just a few yards from Police Headquarters, the city manager, Maurice Jones, said.\n\nThe police chief and mayor declined requests to be interviewed.\n\nMr. Jones said the police had developed two “tactical mobile force contingency plans” that were to be used as “quick responders” to skirmishes and fights that were popping up throughout downtown. The officers were instructed to “respond to fights directly” and to make arrests in teams and squads, he said.\n\n“We saw plenty of video of officers stepping in to de-escalate situations,” Mr. Jones said.\n\nHe stressed that the city had tried to prevent the rally, but that a federal judge had ordered the city to grant the permit. But even a member of the City Council asked the city manager and the police chief why there was an “apparent unwillingness of officers to directly intervene during overt assaults.”\n\nThe city did not use a number of security measures recommended by the state police, said Brian Moran, Virginia’s secretary of public safety and homeland security, including a ban on weapons and sticks of all kinds. The state also proposed designating parking areas, busing protesters and cutting off traffic for at least 10 blocks. None of that happened, he said. Mr. Jones said city laws had prevented officials from enacting some of the restrictions that the state suggested.\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Moran said there may have been a 15-minute gap when skirmishes took place and troopers did not respond, because it took some time for them to suit up in riot gear.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven so, he declined to criticize the response.\n\n“If you stop the clock at 1:30, there were 13 minor injuries, no property damage and no one killed by a firearm,” Mr. Moran said, citing the time just before Ms. Heyer’s death.\n\nBut organizers, participants and counterprotesters said they had felt abandoned.\n\nA 25-year-old woman named Kendall, who asked that her last name not be used because she did not want to be targeted, said she had been chanting at the white-power protesters when one of them punched her, bloodying her nose.\n\n“I moved quickly to the police and said: ‘A man attacked me! Please help me! I need your help. He’s right there!’” she said. “They didn’t move a muscle. Only a few of them had the courage to make eye contact with me.”\n\nÉzé Amos, a photographer from Nigeria who lives in Charlottesville, had a similar experience, he said, when he moved in for a close-up of a man wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with Adolf Hitler’s face. The man punched the camera, hitting Mr. Amos’s face, he said.\n\n“This happened right in front of the cops,” Mr. Amos said. “I said, ‘Hey, this man just assaulted me!’ The officer said, ‘Well I didn’t see it.’ I told him, ‘Everybody just saw it!’”\n\nThe officer took down Mr. Amos’s name.\n\n“I am a black man photographing this. I kept telling myself, ‘If it gets out of hand, the cops will jump in and save me,’” he said. “I saw a white woman get hit, and they did not do anything. That’s when I actually got really scared of the whole thing.”\n\nIt was clear the police were acting with specific instructions, he said.\n\n“Somebody is not telling us what happened,” Mr. Amos said. “Those cops did not just decide to fold their arms and watch this happen.”\n\nThe organizers of the rally said the police had unilaterally changed details that they spent weeks negotiating, such as how they would safely enter and exit the park.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“They didn’t follow through on any part of their plan,” said one of the coordinators, who goes by the name Eli Mosley. “They threw the whole thing away without telling us.” The changes involved every aspect of logistics, he said, including where counterprotesters would be, which streets would be blocked and how V.I.P.s would enter.\n\nMr. Mosely, an event coordinator for Identity Evropa, a white separatist group, said he believed that the city strategy was an attempt to stifle the rise of what has been called the “alt-right.”\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Spencer, one of the headliners who was scheduled to speak at the event, went so far as to blame the city for Ms. Heyer’s death.\n\n“The City of Charlottesville could have prevented that death if they had done their job, and that is to police the streets,” he said.\n\nThe city will not release a copy of the action plan devised to manage the demonstration because it contains “tactical and operational plans that could be used again,” said Miriam Dickler, the city spokeswoman.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe city has hired Timothy J. Heaphy, the former United States attorney for the Western District of Virginia, to conduct an independent review of three white supremacist events, including the “Unite the Right” rally and the Klan rally. Officials urged residents to come forward with firsthand accounts of crimes that went ignored.\n\nAt least one account — the video of the man firing the gunshot with troopers nearby — was shot by someone at the rally and submitted to law enforcement agencies, including the F.B.I.\n\nCorinne Geller, a spokeswoman for the state police, said in an email that the troopers had not heard the shot because it had been “muffled by the loud volume of the crowd yelling and chanting, drums and music.” Another video shows that the gunshot was clearly audible even from inside the park, where dozens more state police troopers were posted.\n\n“Had any one of our troopers witnessed that incident,” Ms. Geller said, “they would have immediately acted just as they did for the other four arrests made during the weekend.”\n\nS. Lee Merritt, an attorney for Mr. Harris, the man who was beaten in the parking garage, said he was surprised to hear the city manager say arrests would be made soon. “I define soon as two weeks ago,” Mr. Merritt said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chris Cantwell, a white supremacist who was featured in a Vice documentary about the “Unite the Right” rally, turned himself in for three felony charges resulting from a pepper-spray attack.

Matthew Emmons/USA TODAY Sports\n\nQB depth chart: The Cowboys are serious about making Cooper Rush their No. 2 behind Prescott, even if Rush is an undrafted free agent. Rush threw two fourth-quarter touchdown passes -- 7 yards to Ronnie Hillman and 44 yards to Lance Lenoir. In four preseason games, Rush has six touchdown passes and no interceptions. Perhaps most impressive on Saturday was his ability to come back from his lost third-quarter fumble, which the Raiders returned 65 yards for a touchdown. In four preseason games, Rush has completed 38 of 51 passes for 398 yards with six touchdowns and no interceptions.\n\nWhen it was starters vs. starters, the Cowboys looked...: At times good and at times shaky. The good was the offense scoring on its first two drives. The shaky was a secondary that was beaten for touchdowns of 17 yards and 48 yards. There appeared to be a miscommunication on Raiders receiver Cordarrelle Patterson's touchdown, and Cowboys safety Byron Jones took a poor angle on receiver Amari Cooper's 48-yarder. The secondary was a big question entering the summer and remains one, especially if the Cowboys can't generate a consistent pass rush.\n\nOne reason to be concerned: The linebacker position might take a huge hit if Anthony Hitchens' right knee injury is serious. He went out with 19 seconds left in the second quarter and did not return. Hitchens is the starting middle linebacker but can also play the weakside. While many have high expectations for Jaylon Smith, he would not start over Hitchens, who was credited with more than 100 tackles last season. Damien Wilson could face a suspension for an offseason arrest, and Smith is working back from a major knee injury. What looked to be a strength for the defense could now be a big-time question.\n\nThat guy can't start: The Cowboys have given Chaz Green every chance to earn the left guard spot this summer. He hasn't been able to stay healthy, which has been the story of his young career. He started off OK at left guard, but then allowed a sack. He moved to left tackle on the Cowboys' final series of the first half and suffered an ankle injury. As much as the Cowboys want Green to be the guy, they just can't rely on him to stay healthy. The left guard spot could be Jonathan Cooper's by default.\n\nIn and out: RB Ezekiel Elliott got 14 snaps in last year's preseason. This year he has played 10. He ran six times for 18 yards and caught two passes for 6 yards on the first drive before his night ended. The Cowboys were not going to put him at risk of injury and wanted to give him a taste of action. This might be his only game action until October because of his six-game suspension. He has an appeal hearing Tuesday in New York and will not take part in practice on Monday or Tuesday.\n\nGood work: Sean Lee played 15 snaps in his longest work of the preseason, which is about what the weakside linebacker needed to get ready for the regular season. Lee was credited with three tackles, but he missed a tackle that led to a long run by Raiders RB DeAndre Washington. If Hitchens is out, Lee's value to the defense increases even more, if that is possible.\n\nRookie watch: Cowboys DE Taco Charlton picked up his second sack in four preseason games when he dropped QB EJ Manuel for a loss in the third quarter. The best part of Charlton's play was his celebration. He appeared to make tacos for his teammates, who gladly consumed them.\n\nKeep the hands close: La'el Collins had been making a smooth transition to right tackle this summer after playing left guard his first two seasons, but he had three penalties (two accepted) in the second quarter. The two illegal-use-of-hands penalties wiped out first-down catches by Beasley and Williams on back-to-back drives.","author":"Todd ArcherESPN Staff Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-08-27T03:17:07.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0826%2Fr249567_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"hMQLIYlwdGXBv8MY1hwDew==\n"}

On Saturday the home secretary said it would remain at this level, implying that despite the arrest there is still thought to be a risk of another imminent attack.\n\nEach time the level has gone to critical, it has only stayed at this highest level of alertness for three to four days - this is partly as it involves an unsustainably high tempo for the police, intelligence and security services.\n\nExtra patrols are mounted on the streets of London, covert surveillance is stepped up and troops are deployed to free up police officers to focus on the main effort: catching the bomber before he can plant another device.\n\nBut the very fact that Friday's attack took place with no warning shows this system is only a broad guide to the threat and simply reflects the latest assessment.\n\nThe BBC understands CCTV images have been obtained of the person suspected of planting the explosive device.\n\nThe Islamic State group has said it was behind the bomb, which detonated at 08:20 BST on Friday.\n\nIt is understood the device had a timer, but the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said the bomb appeared not to have gone off properly.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Police have spoken to 100 witnesses so far and received 180 images and videos from the public\n\nHad it worked as intended, it would have killed everyone around it and maimed everyone in the train carriage for life, he said.\n\nThe Met's Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said it was \"very routine\" for the Islamic State group to claim the attack, whether in contact with those involved or not.\n\nThey urge anyone with information to get in touch and to upload pictures and video to the website www.ukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk or to call the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321.\n\nWere you at Parsons Green station?

People took to the streets raising the Kurdish flags and chanting patriotic songs.\n\nSome of them told me they feel proud because their long overdue dream of independence is finally coming true. They believe the parliamentary move legitimises the referendum, which is seen by the central government in Baghdad as unconstitutional.\n\nInternational, as well as regional, powers like Turkey and Iran have also been very critical of the upcoming voting process, warning of serious repercussions. Both countries have relatively large Kurdish communities and they are afraid of the domino effect that such a referendum could have.\n\nEven among Iraqi Kurds there are divisions. The Change Movement, the main opposition party, has boycotted the parliament session, saying it believes in independence but rejects holding the referendum at this stage.\n\nKurdish leader Massud Barzani said he would give a rapid response to the ideas but appeared to have dismissed them when asked earlier on Friday, before the vote went ahead.\n\n\"We still haven't heard a proposal that can be an alternative to the Kurdistan referendum,\" he said.\n\nMr Barzani's statement was decried by Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said the decision not to postpone was \"very wrong\", Reuters reports.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Massoud Barzani spoke to the BBC\n\nKurds are the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East but they have never obtained a permanent nation state.

I don't know! Like, I'm trying to come up with all those ideas now.\"\n\nImage copyright Madonna/Instagram Image caption Madonna's Tears of a Clown show could be the template for her next tour\n\nThe concerts will presumably owe much to the vaudeville-style Tears of a Clown show that Madonna performed twice in 2016 - once as a gift to fans in Australia, and again at a fundraiser for her Raising Malawi charity.\n\nThe low-key gigs featured the pop icon dressed as a clown, riding a tricycle, chatting to the audience and telling jokes when not performing stripped-back renditions of some of her favourite songs.\n\nFootage of the Australian concert appears on the star's new DVD, released on Friday, which documents her 2015-16 Rebel Heart Tour.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with BBC News, she talked about touring life, changing attitudes to sex, and her recent dispute with a courier company...\n\nBefore we start, there's one thing I need to know: Did your FedEx package ever arrive?\n\nHa ha! Yes, it has. FedEx is blaming customs, customs is blaming FedEx and we'll never know what happened. But I have it now.\n\nSo, I saw the Rebel Heart tour when you were in London and the DVD does a really good job of capturing what it was like to be in the audience. How do you go about that?\n\nI was there every step of the way, every day for months and months. It's really hard to capture the true feeling of the excitement and the passion and the heat and the blood, sweat and tears. I'm pleased with the way it came out.\n\nThere's a particularly touching sequence during True Blue, where everybody in the audience embraces each other.\n\nI know, it's a very sweet, emotional moment in the show. I didn't expect it to be, but when I look back at the DVD it almost brings a tear to my eye because everyone seems so in love.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Rebel Heart tour featured Samurai, matadors and a finale in a 1920s-style Parisian cafe\n\nHow do you put a show like this together? Where do you get the ideas?\n\nEverything's based around my song choice. So first, I go through my catalogue of songs with my band and I start working on things that excite me and inspire me in the moment. Some songs I'm sick of doing and I don't want to do them. Other songs I say, \"No, I did that on the last tour, I don't want to do it again.\"\n\nSo I try to rotate things and I also try to reflect my current mood and what I've been feeling, and what's been inspiring me artistically or filmically, politically, philosophically. I try to put songs together in groups that have thematic connection, and then I try to tell a story. And then I do the visuals. It's quite a process.\n\nWhat are the songs you don't want to do again?\n\nWell, I tend to not want to do the songs I did on the tour before. That's what I mean. So if I did Material Girl on the tour before, or Express Yourself on the tour before, then I'll say, \"OK, I did that for 88 shows. I can't do it again.\"\n\nHow do you keep a healthy balance between new songs and your back catalogue?\n\nIt's just playing in rehearsal. It's really hard for me, especially with my older songs, to do them with the original arrangement. Because 33 years later, after doing it for so long, you just have to reinvent things. Well, I do.\n\nAnd it's fun for me to take an '80s pop song and turn it into a salsa song, or turn it into a samba, or make an uptempo song into a ballad.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption The Blond Ambition tour changed how many people think about pop concerts\n\nThe overarching theme of the tour was being a rebel. In the intro you say, \"when fascist dictators come for you dressed as righteous men\" you have to rise up and take a stand.\n\nIf you were doing the tour against the current political backdrop, would that message feel more relevant?\n\nYeah, I created that voiceover for my short film Secret Project,. I feel like it was a foreshadowing of things to come, like a prophecy.\n\nYou felt something in the air?\n\nI did then - and I think people all thought I was being a little bit dramatic and extreme, but I felt like I was witnessing the beginning of it on the tour previous [to Rebel Heart]. And, of course, look what's happening in the world right now. It's pretty crazy.\n\nTwenty-seven years ago, the Pope tried to get one of your shows banned. Now you have pole-dancing nuns and nobody bats an eyelid. Is that progress?\n\nIs it progress? Well, I guess in some ways you could call that progress. When I released my Sex book, the idea of someone being scantily-clad on the street was an outrage. But look at social media today and it's nothing.\n\nPeople get used to things, but I wouldn't call that progress. What I think of as progress is people becoming more open-minded, and people understanding the difference between art and exploitation.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Madonna has always played with religious iconography in her shows\n\nWhen I was banned by the Pope, I was playing with the ideas of religion and sexuality, which are usually kept completely apart. Sex is considered a sin in the Catholic church. And I was questioning that and challenging that point of view because I don't, obviously, agree with it.\n\nSo now that no one's batting an eyelash about nuns on the stripper poles, it doesn't mean that the Vatican or the Catholic church is soul-searching or investigating whether they made the right choices. I don't think people are thinking that maybe sexuality and God don't need to be separate. That, to me, would be progress.\n\nThe DVD also includes the Tears of a Clown show you did in Melbourne. Was that a one-off or a trial run for a different type of Madonna concert?\n\nI like doing intimate shows and being able to talk directly to the audience; to play with them and use humour and pathos and truth, and share my life - and also make up stories. I like the freedom of it and I like the intimacy of it, and I would like to explore doing it more in the future.\n\nMaybe a residency?\n\nYeah, a residency. If I look back at the Rebel Heart tour, my favourite [part] was really the last section where I got to just sit on the stage and play my ukulele and sing La Vie en Rose and talk to the audience. [It was] just more intimate. More audience participation and connecting to human beings - I feel I'm craving that more and more.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The pop singer played more than 80 shows on her Rebel Heart tour\n\nDid it feel like there was more room for improvisation in that section?\n\nYeah, I have freedom and I can make mistakes. That's another thing I do in Tears of a Clown - if I start a song off wrong and I make a boo-boo, I just turn around and go \"Stop! Let's start again!\"\n\nWhen you're doing a sports arena show, you're linked up to video, you can't stop. Once the train leaves the station, you have to keep going.\n\nThere's a certain kind of adrenalin rush to that - but there's no room for error. So I like the idea of mistakes and freestyling. Free-falling, really. It's more exciting to me right now.\n\nMadonna: Rebel Heart Tour is out now on DVD, CD and Blu-Ray and via digital retailers.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

it was an amazing effort to get us back in the game.\"\n\nEngland bowler Liam Plunkett, who took 3-27: \"You have to be on your game against the likes of Lewis and Gayle but even sometimes that doesn't work out.\n\n\"We are disappointed, we lost wickets in the middle that we will look at but the game was there to win, we felt like we could win it. Even in the last four or five overs.\"\n\nMan-of-the-match Sunil Narine, who took 2-15: \"It's a total team effort.

We are so happy'\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Pep Guardiola says he 'didn't expect' to win by huge scoreline\n\nTalks of a hangover from a midweek 4-0 win at Feyenoord in the Champions League were quickly put to bed when Manchester City got started at Vicarage Road.\n\nGuardiola's side controlled possession throughout, and returned from the half-time break wanting more even after taking a 3-0 first-half lead.\n\n\"It was so good. Especially after an away game in the Champions League. The way we played as a team, we are so happy,\" said the City boss.\n\n\"I was lucky to manage Barcelona with many outstanding performances but this week has been a lot of goals. We have found our game, we can make short passes and we have a lot of energy from our full-backs.\"\n\nCity had 28 shots in total with 10 on target - five in each half - while individually, David Silva had 88 touches, completing 93% of his passes with two assists, and De Bruyne also impressed making four key passes and setting up the opener.\n\nBut Aguero was the one man who impressed the most.\n\nAguero closes in on all-time City record\n\nAguero was in uncompromising form in front of goal once again, and he has now scored nine goals in five games against the Hornets.\n\nGuardiola particularly enjoyed the 29-year-old's third goal, where he received the ball from Kyle Walker, ran past several yellow shirts and maintained his composure to sneak the ball home from an acute angle.\n\n\"His numbers speak for themselves,\" said Guardiola. \"I'm so happy for the third goal because he's so clever in the box. He's able to score a goal at any point.\"\n\nAguero's hat-trick - his sixth in the Premier League and 10th for City - has moved the Argentine only two away from Manchester City's all-time scoring record of 177, set by Eric Brook between 1928 and 1940.\n\nSilva brought down to earth with a bang\n\nMarco Silva exchanged words with referee Andy Taylor at the end of the match\n\nMarco Silva had made a good start to life as Watford manager, with two wins and two draws from their opening four league matches.\n\nBut City provided the Hornets with their first real test from a title contender and they buckled under the pressure.\n\nDespite being under the cosh for the first half an hour, Watford were able to break forward on the counter-attack and Richarlison had the best chance to head home before City went on the rampage.\n\nSilva felt aggrieved that the offside flag was not raised for Aguero's opener and Jesus's goal in the first half, although the decisions were not wildly contested by the players on the field.\n\nThey also had a penalty shout when Walker clumsily clattered into Nathaniel Chalobah.\n\nThe Hornets did not play badly, but City were just too good.\n\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero\n\nIt had to be the hat-trick man. One fan got so overwhelmed by Aguero's performance that he ran on the pitch for a selfie at the end, embraced the striker and appeared quite emotional as he was dragged away by security.\n\nMan City love a trip to Vicarage Road\n\nMan City (11) have scored more goals in their last two Premier League games at Vicarage Road than Watford (10) have in their last nine at the ground.\n\nGabriel Jesus has been directly involved in 15 goals in his 15 Premier League appearances (11 goals, 4 assists).\n\nSergio Aguero scored his sixth Premier League hat-trick; only Alan Shearer (11), Robbie Fowler (9), Michael Owen and Thierry Henry (8) have scored more.\n\nAguero has been involved in 11 goals in five appearances against Watford in all competitions (nine goals, two assists).\n\nDavid Silva provided two assists in a Premier League game for the first time since March 2016 versus Aston Villa.\n\nPost-match reaction\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Marco Silva believes 'offsides' changed game for Watford\n\nWatford boss Marco Silva: \"The first and third goals are offside, it is not a normal game.

And the South Korean had little to do defensively.\n\nAurier's introduction on 63 minutes at left-back allowed Son to push further up in attack, while Llorente came on against his former club to offer a different attacking option.\n\nTottenham have gone three league home games in a row without a win for the first time since December 2013.

Photographer: Mike Theiler/AFP via Getty Images\n\n“Next week is not going to be short on topics,” the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, told reporters at the White House on Friday. She acknowledged that foreign leaders are curious about how the unpredictable U.S. president will maneuver.\n\n“They are all very anxious to hear what he has to say,” Haley said. “And I think that he will make quite an impact.”\n\nTrump’s appearance at the UN -- highlighted by an address Tuesday before the world body -- is his biggest moment on the world stage since taking office. There is far more at stake than at the two economic summits in Europe he attended earlier this year. As he welcomes leaders from nearly 200 nations to his home town of New York, he’ll press them to join U.S. efforts to constrain missile and nuclear programs in both North Korea and Iran.\n\nTensions have risen sharply with both nations since Trump took office and assumed a more confrontational posture than his predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\nMajor Speech\n\n“The world is still trying to take the measure of this president,” said Jon Alterman, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “For a number of leaders, this is going to be their first chance to see him, to judge him, to try to get on his good side.”\n\nIn New York, Trump will hold a series of individual and small-group meetings with leaders from the Mideast, Latin America, Africa and Europe. He’ll headline the UN secretary general’s reform campaign, a 120-nation initiative. He’ll also continue two traditions of U.S. presidents at the UN: the major speech, on Tuesday, and a diplomatic reception planned for Monday evening.\n\n“I personally think he slaps the right people, he hugs the right people, and he comes out with the U.S. being very strong in the end,” said Haley, who has seen a draft of Trump’s address.\n\nIn addition to Trump and Haley, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, the president’s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn, are all expected to attend events in New York next week. Two key foreign leaders will not be on hand: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nObama is also expected to be in New York during the UN gathering, for an event sponsored by the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation that will draw international figures.\n\nNuclear Crises\n\nThe North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs are foremost on the president’s agenda. North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile with the range to reach Guam early on Friday, its latest in a series of provocations, and the Trump administration is seeking to extend and strengthen the Iranian nuclear deal that Obama signed and Trump has repeatedly maligned.\n\nTrump will discuss the North Korea crisis over lunch with the leaders of South Korea and Japan. McMaster said Friday that the world is “out of time” to stop North Korea from becoming a nuclear state.\n\n“What we have to do is call on all nations, call on everyone to do everything we can to address this global problem short of war,” he told reporters at the briefing. McMaster and Haley both insisted that the U.S. does have military options in the dispute, contrary to conventional wisdom that the city of Seoul’s vulnerability to a North Korean counterattack rules out the possibility of a strike.\n\nThe Trump administration is pressuring China to use its oil deliveries to North Korea as leverage in the nuclear dispute. The president must decide by mid-October whether to keep the U.S. in the Iran nuclear deal.\n\n‘Most Tedious’ Party\n\nTrump’s first UN General Assembly follows overseas visits early in his presidency to the Mideast, where he sought to bolster relations with Saudi Arabia and reignite the Mideast peace process, and to Europe, where Western allies were alarmed by the president’s inconsistent commitment to the NATO alliance and his withdrawal from the Paris climate accords.\n\nThe U.S. president has a chance to surprise international leaders with a shift toward coalition-building on the world stage, Alterman said, noting Trump’s recent outreach domestically to his political opponents in the Democratic Party. But that will depend on whether he learns to navigate the institution.\n\n“He must look at it partly as an opportunity to have the world’s attention,” Alterman said. “And partly it’s the world’s most tedious cocktail party.”\n\n— With assistance by Toluse Olorunnipa, and Justin Sink","author":"Margaret Talev","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T08:00:00.000Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i_wbR9NjRQXk/v0/1200x793.jpg","digest":"RZgQpj5QGLHBlmhlgjlP2w==\n"}

The U.K. threat level remained at critical.\n\nThe man detained in Dover was held under a section of the U.K. Terrorism Act, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. He has since been transferred to a police station in London. Dover’s port is the main ferry link between the U.K. and France. Over 12 million passengers as well as millions of cars and trucks passed through the port in 2016.\n\nOfficers later Saturday evacuated residents in a section of Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) southwest of London, as they searched a home as “a precautionary measure” after the arrest, according to a statement.\n\nThat search “will take some time,” Neil Basu, the Metropolitan Police’s senior national co-ordinator for counter terrorism policy, said in a statement. “We are keeping an open mind around whether more than one person is responsible for the attack and we are still pursuing numerous lines of inquiry and at a great pace.”\n\nPolice have identified 121 witnesses so far and spoken to 100 of them already. Officers continue to trawl through hours of closed-circuit television footage and videos and photographs sent by members of the public, Basu said.\n\n‘Significant Arrest’\n\n“This is a very significant arrest,” Home Secretary Amber Rudd said in a televised interview Saturday after a meeting of the government’s crisis response committee. “The police have made very good progress, but the operation is ongoing.”\n\nThe U.K. terror threat level was raised to the highest level, signaling further attacks may be imminent, Prime Minister Theresa May said late Friday, as police hunted for suspects who set off the improvised bomb at the Parsons Green station at about 8:20 a.m., causing what witnesses described as a fireball. The joint terrorism analysis center’s assessment “is that further attacks may be imminent,” May said in a recorded statement.\n\nMay said earlier that the device was “intended to cause serious harm.” Sky News broadcast images of a small fire in a bucket and Lidl shopping bag with wires protruding and said the device, which had a timer, had probably failed to detonate fully.\n\n‘Remain Vigilant’\n\n“The public should remain vigilant as our staff, officers and partners continue to work through this complex investigation,” Basu said in the statement announcing the arrest.\n\nTroops have been deployed as part of an operation to free up some 1,000 armed police so they can protect transport hubs and events.\n\n“The police investigation is ongoing and there will still be significant activity today and over the days ahead,” London Mayor Sadiq Khan said in a statement. “London will never be intimidated by terrorism.”\n\nEmergency services attend Parsons Green Station, in London, Sept. 15. Photographer: Jack Taylor/Getty Images\n\nTrump Storm\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said Friday on Twitter that the “loser terrorist” was “in the sights of Scotland Yard,” a reference to the headquarters of London’s Metropolitan Police Service.\n\nMay complained directly to him when Trump called to offer condolences, according to a U.K. government official familiar with the conversation. She was more measured in a pooled broadcast interview earlier: “I never think it’s helpful for anyone to speculate on what’s an ongoing investigation.”\n\nRudd said Saturday it was “much too early” to say whether the man in custody was known to the authorities.\n\nIn an apparent U.S. leak, CBS reported that the explosives were consistent with those used in another recent attack. The U.S. and U.K. have close intelligence-sharing ties and the U.K. has publicly criticized U.S. leaks of police intelligence after previous attacks.\n\nRead more: Trump Sparks Anger in U.K. Over Tweets on London Attack\n\nThe attack is the fifth this year in the U.K. and Londoners are growing accustomed to the sight of armed police patrolling the transport network. Police said on Thursday that terrorism-related arrests had risen 68 percent over the past year.\n\nEarlier this year assailants with vans and knives attacked passers by on Westminster Bridge and London Bridge in two separate strikes, and a van was driven into worshippers outside a mosque in Finsbury Park. A suicide bomber attacked a concert venue in Manchester in May, killing more than 20 people including children and mothers. The terror threat level was raised to critical after that attack and lowered four days later to severe, meaning an attack is considered highly likely but not imminent.\n\nMost of the attacks have been claimed or praised by the jihadist group Islamic State. On Friday, the Amaq news outlet said the London explosion had been carried out by a “group following the Islamic State.”\n\nAfter the explosion at Parsons Green station in southwest London, passengers were caught in a stampede as they tried to flee. Ambulances rushed people to hospital, although the injuries weren’t life-threatening with most suffering what police called “flash burns” to their faces, hands and hair.\n\n“There was a massive flash and flame that went up the side of the train, then an acrid chemical smell, then a big stampede,” Chris Wildish, a witness, told Sky News. “The crush for the stairs was pretty heavy.”\n\n— With assistance by Chris Kingdon, Joe Easton, Thomas Seal, and Tim Ross","author":"Emma Ross-Thomas, Thomas Penny, Benjamin D Katz","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T10:41:01.749Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iPRoJQlC_Fx0/v0/1200x735.jpg","digest":"FJNbE9cepe0MG84u7fYEaA==\n"}

This comes more than a year after the NHTSA first started looking into odors and exhaust issues in the vehicles.\n\nThe NHTSA said on its website that it has upgraded the probe to an \"engineering analysis\" after receiving at least 2,719 complaints pertaining to those model year Explorers.\n\nA Ford representative couldn’t be reached for comment Saturday outside of regular business hours.\n\nIn an interview with CBS News last month, Ford spokeswoman Elizabeth Weigandt said a closer analysis of the car revealed a carbon monoxide concentration of 13 parts per million. The current permissible exposure limit established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is 50 parts per million.\n\nCrashes, Injuries\n\nThree crashes and 41 injuries have been potentially linked to the issue since July 1, 2016, according to an NHTSA filing. Cited were complaints of nausea, headaches and loss of consciousness, all common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nIn August, a police officer in Auburn, Massachusetts, reportedly passed out and crashed while driving a Ford Explorer SUV specially designed for law enforcement use. He tested positive for the noxious gas. A Ford representative at the time told CBS News it would be \"premature to draw conclusions\" from the incident.\n\nThe Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker has made efforts short of a recall to address the problem, paying to repair police versions of the Explorers to correct possible leaks in July.

Jose’s path could put it near New Jersey and New York by Wednesday morning, although it may weaken to a tropical storm again by then, the center said.\n\nThe storm may add to an already devastating 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, coming just after Hurricane Harvey inundated Texas and Hurricane Irma raked Florida’s west coast, leaving dozens of people dead and upending energy and agriculture markets. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy created about $70 billion of damage after hitting the New York metropolitan region.\n\nAs of 11 a.m. New York time, Jose was moving northwest at 9 miles an hour with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph. Little change in strength is forecast during the next two days, the center said. Tropical storm watches could be issued for parts of the U.S. coast, from North Carolina to New England, over the next day or two, according to the advisory, the 45th so far on the long-lived weather system.\n\nJose could affect five refineries along the East Coast that are able to process about 1.1 million barrels a day of oil, Bloomberg data showed.\n\nIf it continues toward New York City, Jose could disrupt vessels carrying crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products along the Atlantic seaboard, “particularly those making deliveries to New York Harbor,” Shunondo Basu, a Bloomberg New Energy Finance meteorologist and natural gas analyst in New York, said on Friday.\n\nStaying Offshore?\n\nStill, some forecasters see Jose staying far enough offshore to avoid any major impact to the U.S. The hurricane center’s margin of error for a storm five days out is about 225 miles, on average.\n\nAccuWeather Inc. sees the storm passing within 200 miles of the Northeast. Landfall in New England during the middle of the week can’t be ruled out, senior meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said in a statement. If landfall were to occur, the most likely location would be far eastern Long Island or southeastern New England, especially Cape Cod.\n\nThere’s an 18 percent chance of tropical storm-force winds in New York City between Tuesday and Wednesday, said Jeff Masters, co-founder of Weather Underground in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nIf Jose continues on its path, the most immediate impact could be tall, swelling waves “pounding the coasts” until at least Wednesday, Masters said.\n\nCategory one hurricane Norma, meanwhile, remains stationary about 250 miles south of the popular tourist destination of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, and is forecast to start moving slowly north later on Saturday. Tropical storm warnings and watches are in effect, with heavy rains likely and maximum sustained winds of about 75 miles per hour.\n\nAs the busy 2017 hurricane season continues, a depression west of the Cabo Verde Islands in the central Atlantic Ocean strengthened into Tropical Storm Lee, the NHC said. Lee is forecast to move slowly west or west-northwest for a few days.\n\nMeanwhile, storm watches were issued for parts of the Caribbean islands of St. Lucia, Martinique, Guadeloupe and Dominica from a system that may become a tropical cyclone.","author":"Emma Ockerman","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-15T17:22:50.993Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i73ZqyKg4Gxs/v0/1200x782.jpg","digest":"NI7FYJJ2fu/Es62ZKpODqA==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"59bdac4b03c1c0e548b2c09c"},"description":"As opioids sweep across the nation, one Ohio county wants to make a lifesaving drug widely available. Another has a much harsher approach.","title":"Surviving a Heroin Overdose May Soon Depend on Where You Live","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-14/welcome-to-the-narcan-capital-of-america","text":"Medical workers and police treat a woman who has overdosed on heroin, the second case in a matter of minutes, in Warren, Ohio.\n\nIn southwest Ohio, people die from drug overdoses at more than double the national rate. In the future, whether someone survives could hinge on what county they’re in.\n\nThe sheriff in Butler County this summer declared that his officers wouldn’t carry medication to reverse overdoses. In Middletown, a city of 49,000 that overlaps the county, a council member frustrated by ballooning costs went even further, suggesting ambulance crews shouldn’t have to save the lives of some people who have been revived before.\n\nIn neighboring Hamilton County, which includes Cincinnati, officials are taking the opposite approach. They want to create the Narcan capital of America, putting more than 30,000 doses of the opioid-overdose reversal spray in the hands of Ohioans ready to use it. That’s about one for every 27 residents. In addition to police, firefighters, and medics who already carry the drug, Hamilton County plans to distribute Narcan to syringe exchanges, houses of worship—and maybe even employers. People discharged from hospitals or jails after opioid incidents should leave with “Narcan on the belt,” says Tim Ingram, Hamilton County’s health commissioner.\n\nThe contrast between these approaches mirrors the national debate over how to deal with a drug crisis that killed 33,000 Americans in 2015, a tally expected to increase. The epidemic began years ago as doctors started to liberally prescribe opioid painkillers such as oxycodone. As addiction and abuse rose, the medical industry began to tighten access, drivng up street prices. Drug cartels saw an opportunity and flooded U.S. cities with cheap heroin, a common substitute.\n\nPhotographer: Drew Angerer/Getty Images North America\n\nNowadays, heroin is often laced with such potent synthetic drugs as fentanyl or the elephant tranquilizer carfentanil, which can be deadly in minuscule doses. As drug poisonings keep rising, communities have to decide how easy it should be for people who overdose to get life-saving medicines—and at what cost.\n\nForty-five states and the District of Columbia allow naloxone, the active chemical in Narcan spray, to be obtained without a prescription. Naloxone isn’t addictive and doesn’t induce a high, so it can’t be abused. President Donald Trump’s opioid commission urged in a July draft report that “Naloxone be in the hands of every law enforcement officer” and suggested doctors also prescribe it in tandem with risky painkillers. Between 1996 and 2014, naloxone dispensed by “laypersons”—including drug users, family members, and other bystanders—reversed at least 26,000 overdoses, the Centers for Diseases Control has reported.\n\n“This is pretty egregious to think that you would just deny people care that would save their lives”\n\nRaising awareness about naloxone has “been a struggle,” says Reilly Glasgow, project manager at the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center in New York City. The nonprofit provides syringe exchange, counseling, and other services to people suffering from addiction. The group hands out free naloxone kits at 800 training sessions each year. “To me, it’s criminal to let this sit on the shelf,” Glasgow says.\n\nDan Picard, the Middletown, Ohio, council member who proposed limiting naloxone for repeat overdoses, stands on the opposite side of the divide. Picard says drug poisonings in Middletown have dropped since his suggestion made national headlines in June. “Every overdose run costs the city $1,104,” Picard says, adding that Middletown had been on track to spend 10 times the $10,000 it budgeted for Narcan.\n\nA billboard encouraging help and recovery from heroin addiction in Middletown, Ohio. Photographer: Andrew Spear/Redux\n\n“My comments scared people,” he contends. “At some point in life people need to have some personal responsibility.”\n\nButler County Sheriff Richard Jones says people can get Narcan at pharmacies or from paramedics, but his officers won’t carry it. “Everything’s being spent on the treatment of the addict,” he says, adding that more money should go to prevention and school programs to discourage drug use, citing the DARE program and the “Just Say No” campaign Nancy Reagan championed. “I’m here on the front lines, and people are fed up with this. I had a guy call me the other day saying, ‘I don’t get free insulin.’”\n\nLast year Butler County recorded 211 fatal drug overdoses, and the death rate is among the highest in Ohio.\n\nResidents, activists, and recovering addicts prepare to march through the streets of Norwalk, Ohio. Photographer: Spencer Platt/Getty Images North America\n\nJones says he’s not aware of anyone who died because his officers didn’t have naloxone, and he notes that medics usually arrive at the same time as police. Picard says Middletown does plenty to get people into treatment, including sending response teams the day after overdoses to follow up.\n\nWithholding emergency treatment after an overdose would violate medical ethics, says Andrew Aronsohn, a doctor and faculty member at the MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago Medical Center. Addiction carries a particular stigma, but society rarely questions whether other medical conditions resulting from personal behavior deserve treatment, from a smokers’ lung cancer or a drunk drivers’ injuries after a crash, he says. “When someone’s dying in front of you, that’s not really our place to judge all of those things as medical providers,” Aronsohn says. “This is pretty egregious to think that you would just deny people care that would save their lives.”\n\n\n\nMike DeWine, Ohio’s Republican attorney general, is currently suing prescription opioid manufacturers, alleging that they downplayed addiction risks. He says that, while he understands why some officials are exasperated with reviving people who may overdose again, they should do it anyway. “You’ve got law enforcement officers who are doing things that five years ago none of them ever would have dreamed they’d be doing—but it’s the right thing to do,” says DeWine, a former U.S. senator who is also running for governor. The epidemic requires both public health and law enforcement solutions, he says, such as drug courts and programs in which police help connect people to treatment.\n\nResearchers at the University of Cincinnati will track the Hamilton County experiment to see what effect it has on deadly overdoses. “If you really put an emphasis on nalaxone and put it out there everywhere, how many lives will you be able to save?” DeWine says. Hamilton County’s five hospitals as well as other providers and community groups pledged $550,000 in cash, including $25,000 from the county, to fund the program for the next two years.\n\n“This could be a blueprint for what other communities need to do”\n\nThat funding doesn’t cover the cost of 25,000 doses of Narcan that manufacturer Adapt Pharma will donate. Hamilton County has already distributed 7,000 of doses of naloxone over the past two years, mostly through emergency responders. Narcan can be delivered without training and is already available at pharmacies in almost every state, usually on “standing order,” meaning people can get it without a prescription. Mike Kelly, who runs U.S. operations for Dublin, Ireland-based Adapt, says public awareness is the biggest barrier to more widespread use. New York and Massachusetts are doing public ad campaigns to alert people that naloxone is available at pharmacies.\n\nMike DeWine. Photographer: Brooke LaValley/The Columbus Dispatch via AP Photo\n\nIf the Hamilton County program reduces deaths, he says, “this could be a blueprint for what other communities need to do.” A successful demonstration could also broaden the market for Narcan, providing a commercial opportunity for closely held Adapt. Narcan prescriptions have increased to 530,000 doses so far in 2017, up from 229,000 doses in all of 2016, according to data from Symphony Health Solutions that was compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nOther Ohio counties support expanding Narcan availability. On the other side of the state, police in Lorain County averted 350 fatal overdoses over the past four years using naloxone, says Detective Gregg Mehling of the county’s drug task force. Medics have saved many more. “If this guy’s going to live another day, it’s in your hands,” he says. Mehling supports having Narcan in schools and workplaces, alongside fire extinguishers and automated defibrillators. “You hope you never use them.”\n\nLast year, Lorain County had 146 drug overdose deaths—double the rate in recent years. Mehling says that, without Narcan, the numbers would be “two or three times worse.”\n\nNo one thinks Narcan alone is sufficient. While making it more widely available is a “no brainer,” the U.S. needs a greater focus on prevention and access to treatment, says Andrew Kolodny, executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing and a researcher at Brandeis University. People with addiction should find it easier to “access treatment than heroin,” he says. “That person should be able to walk into a treatment facility regardless of the ability to pay.”\n\nIngram, the Hamilton County health commissioner, agrees that people need treatment, counseling, and social support to beat addiction. While treatment facility capacity is expanding, there still aren’t enough beds. Making Narcan more widely available, he says, will at least keep people out of the morgue.\n\nWatch Next: How America’s Opioid Crisis Spiraled Out of Control","author":"John Tozzi, Jared S Hopkins","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-14T08:00:07.144Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/idS5JXJ0Ps9o/v0/1200x800.jpg","digest":"wBazyNmFJe/sd68WtJWZFg==\n"}

Their preliminary settlement with the CFPB was reached by their ultimate owner, VCG Securities LLC, a Florida-based investment firm led by Donald Uderitz. If finalized, it would require the payment of “large sums” in restitution to borrowers and civil penalties to the U.S. government, according to a summary of the proposal filed in a separate court case.\n\nThe specific terms of the draft settlement weren’t clear Friday. David Mayorga, a CFPB spokesman, declined to comment. Uderitz said he couldn’t comment on the settlement because he was bound by confidentiality. Past settlements have required loan companies to correct business practices the CFPB considers improper.\n\nThe trusts, created more than a decade ago, cumulatively have held well over 874,000 loans made to more than 812,000 people who borrowed money from banks mostly to pay for their higher education, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and monthly reports to investors. Those banks sold the loans to a middleman who created the trusts, and the trusts then sold notes promising certain returns to investors ranging from the hedge-fund manager Waterfall Asset Management LLC to the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation. Monthly payments to investors are backed by borrowers’ monthly payments on their student loans.\n\nThe loans, made by banks such as JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co. and Bank of America Corp., largely went to borrowers with good credit scores, and more than 80 percent of them were co-signed by someone else, like a parent, securities filings show. But many of them came due in the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crisis, and borrowers ended up defaulting at record rates.\n\nOf the original $12 billion in loan principal bundled into the trusts, about 42 percent—$5 billion, including interest—were in default as of June 30, the trusts’ administrator’s disclosures to investors show.\n\nInitially, investors who bought the loan-backed securities had generous protection against the risk that borrowers would default en masse—but the 2008 bankruptcy of the nonprofit that had guaranteed their loans ended that arrangement. Collection efforts in the form of mass lawsuits filed by debt-collection law firms ensued.\n\nConsumer lawyers say borrowers generally don’t show up in court, leading to default judgments against them that could eventually lead to wage garnishment. But the lawsuits haven’t led to big recoveries for investors. And in recent years, a number of judges around the U.S. have dismissed the trusts’ lawsuits against borrowers or else ruled against their debt collectors, citing sloppy paperwork.\n\nOf the more than $4.1 billion of defaulted loans that insurance didn’t cover, investors have recovered $538 million—or 13 cents out of every $1 in default. The rest remains unpaid.\n\nAll 10 of the worst-performing student-loan investment vehicles ever created, when measured by defaults on the underlying loans relative to amounts borrowed, are among the 15 National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts, said Jon Riber, a DBRS Inc. analyst who specializes in consumer debt that’s been bundled into securities.\n\nLast month, Ambac Financial Group Inc., which has nearly $1 billion of exposure to the securities through insurance it sold investors, cited a potential CFPB enforcement action as one reason it could be forced to set aside an extra $200 million to cover losses.\n\nSean Silva, an outside spokesman for Ambac, didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. Neither did Tristan Fleming, general counsel of Goal Structured Solutions Inc., the parent company of the trusts’ administrator; representatives for Transworld Systems Inc., the debt collector that hires law firms to pursue borrowers in court; nor Nathan Hench or Keith New, spokesmen for the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, which handles the accounts of borrowers who are making steady payments. Dana Ripley, a spokesman for U.S. Bancorp, which ultimately oversees debt collection on behalf of the trusts, declined to comment.\n\nUderitz, the Florida investor whose firm VCG ultimately owns the National Collegiate trusts, for years has been trying to assert management of them in order to juice recoveries, legal filings show. As part of that effort, he partnered with Boston Portfolio Advisors Inc., a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based firm, to form a student loan company called Odyssey Education Resources LLC in order to collect from borrowers they say have defaulted, in some cases by reducing their balances.\n\nHe reckons that his newer company can do a better job than the trusts’ existing loan contractors.

In the book, Tory strategists praise Corbyn’s campaign machine while reflecting on their own mistakes.\n\n“We called a snap election and our troops weren’t ready,” said First Secretary of State Green, a long-standing friend of May. “None of us was expecting a snap election, but Labour were.”\n\nThe ongoing recriminations over May’s failed election campaign are likely to boost May’s rivals and opponents at a sensitive time. The loss of her party’s majority in June’s vote undermined the prime minister’s authority over the government and has allowed Tory colleagues to begin plotting to succeed her.\n\nFor example, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson set out what political observers saw as a pitch for the top job in a 4,000-word article for the Tory-supporting Daily Telegraph newspaper on Saturday.\n\nPlots and Gossip\n\nMay will seek to regain the initiative with a major speech on Brexit in Florence, Italy, on Sept. 22, before the Conservative Party holds its annual conference in Manchester in October. The four-day conference is an occasion for potential leadership candidates to parade in front of party members, while their allies plot and gossip over dinner and drinks receptions on the sidelines.\n\nThe cloud hanging over the conference will be the spectacular failure of May’s election gamble earlier this year -- and the question of how long she can last in her job.\n\nAt the start of the short election campaign, Jim Messina, a former aide to U.S. President Barack Obama who worked for May, predicted the Tories would win 470 seats. This would have been enough for a vast parliamentary majority of 290, according to the book, which is being serialized by the Mail on Sunday newspaper.\n\nBut a combination of strategic mistakes by Tories and an effective campaign from the left-wing Labour leader and his huge army of activists delivered a major shock. May lost her majority altogether and now has to run Britain with a minority government, propped up by Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party; Corbyn’s party finished with 30 more seats, narrowing the gap with the Conservatives.\n\nEven Lynton Crosby, the election consultant who helped run the Tory campaign, was impressed with the opposition. “Labour had an infrastructure in place,” Crosby told Ross and McTague. “You can have the best techniques in the world and all the money you want, but it doesn’t matter if you can’t get people out to vote on the day.”","author":"Thomas Penny","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T21:29:19.225Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i5YxrIJK8tDg/v0/1200x767.jpg","digest":"ipQ3DuP0qMOYWWuPLsjTSA==\n"}

A portable planet.\n\nToday, in one of the most thrilling moments—and, for the mission’s scientists and engineers, perhaps the saddest—the orbiter Cassini-Huygens plunged toward Saturn at nearly 80,000 miles an hour to incinerate itself. “That would be the end of the spacecraft,” a voice announced at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in California, as the team lost Cassini’s signal.\n\nThe program manager, Earl Maize, congratulated everyone and then basically did a mic drop. “I'm gonna call this the end of mission,” he said. Extremely well-earned hugs ensued. You can watch the postgame show here.\n\nLooking forward, NASA still has a ton of data (scientifically speaking) to sift through, including the spacecraft’s closest sniff of Saturn’s atmosphere as it melted the orbiter into nothing. Some of that data could drop hints about the formation of the universe.\n\nCassini, which set out on its seven-year trek in 1997 and had been sending back images and data from Saturn since 2004, began making bolder sorties late last year as it neared the end of its fuel and its life. Since the spring it had swooped between the innermost ring and the planet itself, Star Wars style, to send back ever more granular data and ever grander photos.\n\nSaturn’s moons Titan and Enceladus are two of the most promising places in our solar system for the discovery of extraterrestrial life. A few minutes before 8 am Eastern Time, Cassini hurtled to its end. NASA and its partners in the mission, the European and Italian space agencies, didn’t want to risk the spacecraft’s crashing into one of the planet’s moons someday and contaminating them with alien life. That would be us.\n\nHere are 11 of the best pictures ever to come out of anybody’s trip abroad.","author":"","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-15T11:48:37.200Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iu_VHhPPfUkQ/v0/1200x1200.jpg","digest":"xCgH084apXV/n0/kgihmOg==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"59bdac6103c1c0e548b2c0aa"},"description":"What were five historically black schools doing on a brief supporting a Texas oil tycoon's heirs in a tax dispute?","title":"How Anna Nicole Smith’s Billionaire In-Laws Secretly Lobbied the Courts","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-anna-nicole-smith-billionaire-in-laws-court-lobbying/","text":"“If one side has lots of money and the other side doesn’t have lots of money, that creates the possibility that the power of amici is only available to one side,” Simard said. “You’re giving the party with more resources more guns—more weapons to go after the party with fewer resources.”\n\nLinda Sandstrom Simard , a law professor at Suffolk University in Boston who studies amicus briefs and wasn’t familiar with the Marshall case, said she’d never heard of an example of the court rules being violated. That kind of thing, she said, would pervert the system of justice.\n\nPreston Marshall denied making that statement and said in an email to Bloomberg News that the letter, written in the context of a bitter squabble among family members, was “full of distortions.” He acknowledged working with DCI but said other relatives were also involved. “I am not aware of any quid pro quo payments,” he said.\n\nHunter’s letter noted that amici are required to disclose financial support to the courts. “Preston also states that no perjury attaches to the amicus briefs and representations to the courts because no support was funneled to the filers until after the filings,” Hunter wrote, calling the matter appalling. The letter didn’t specify which organizations were paid.\n\nA Marshall family lawyer, Edwin Hunter, described the campaign in a confidential 2015 letter later made public in an unrelated lawsuit. According to Hunter, DCI recruited amici as part of a $5.7 million, six-year effort to improve the family’s image. The letter says the firm’s work was supervised by Preston Marshall, a grandson of J. Howard’s.\n\nThe campaign spanned the family’s Supreme Court dispute with Anna Nicole Smith over her share of Marshall’s fortune, which derives largely from a stake in Koch Industries Inc., as well as the separate tax matter. Each case attracted multiple pro-Marshall amicus briefs and was narrowly decided in the family’s favor, saving it tens of millions of dollars.\n\nBut an examination of the Marshalls’ influence campaign shows how this safeguard can be illusory. Names of some supposed amici were used without their permission; at least one amicus got an undisclosed payment from the Marshalls’ consulting firm; another said he was misled about the source of an undisclosed payment used to secure his help. Two more briefs supporting the Marshalls in unrelated cases came from the same nonprofit, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, which has ties to the consulting firm, DCI Group LLC .\n\nPursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 29(c)(5), amici curiae state that no counsel for any party to this dispute authored this brief in whole or in part, and no person or entity other than amici curiae and their counsel contributed money that was intended to fund preparing or submitting the brief.\n\nIn order to impose some transparency, and to discourage well-funded litigants from using such briefs to overwhelm opponents, the Supreme Court and federal appeals courts require amici to state whether anyone is paying them for their participation.\n\nThe friend of the court, or amicus curiae, occupies a peculiar place in the U.S. legal system. Amici are meant to be outside voices, aiding judges by making arguments the parties don’t. Although they’ve been around for more than a century, they’ve proliferated in recent years. The Supreme Court received 863 amicus briefs in the 2015-2016 term, double the number 20 years earlier and more than it got in the whole decade of the 1950s.\n\nThe brief was part of a campaign by the Marshall family, orchestrated by a Washington consulting firm, to influence two of the nation’s highest courts, according to an examination of confidential documents and emails as well as interviews with participants. The campaign shows how it’s possible for well-funded litigants to stack the deck by generating phony friends of the court, or by paying advocates who present themselves as independent but are really lobbyists in disguise.\n\n“ I don’t remember it specifically ,” but “I just trust [Carter] in a way that I don’t believe he would fabricate that .”\n\n“I have a feeling someone forged whatever it was,” said David Olah, Barber-Scotia’s president, echoing the school’s outside lawyer and its former executive chairman.\n\nBarber-Scotia might seem the last place for the family of J. Howard Marshall II, famous for his May-December romance with Playboy centerfold Anna Nicole Smith, to look for help with a tax matter. And top officials there say they’ve never heard of the case. Yet there was Barber-Scotia’s name, along with those of four other historically black colleges and universities, on a friend-of-the-court brief submitted in 2013 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans.\n\nThe school, founded in North Carolina after the Civil War to educate the daughters of freed slaves , had fallen on hard times. Stripped of accreditation and mired in debt, it sometimes wasn’t able to pay staff.\n\nWhen the heirs of a Texas oil billionaire went to court in a $75 million tax dispute, they got help from an unlikely ally: Barber-Scotia College, the nation’s first institution of higher learning for black women.\n\nHow five historically black schools wound up on an amicus brief supporting a billionaire’s family in a tax dispute with the IRS\n\nWhite Tuxedo\n\nThe Marshalls’ tangled legal disputes arose from their patriarch’s last few months of life. He wed Smith in 1994 at Houston’s White Dove Wedding Chapel. The groom was 89, in a wheelchair and white tuxedo. His blue-jeans-model bride was 26, in satin, cut low.\n\nMarshall died about a year into the marriage with a will providing nothing for his widow. Smith claimed her husband had instructed lawyers to give her half of his wealth—then estimated to be more than $1 billion—but his son Pierce thwarted the plan. Courts issued conflicting judgments and lawsuits multiplied, outliving both Pierce and his onetime stepmother.\n\nWhen the case came before the Supreme Court in 2010, it attracted a stack of amicus briefs, four in favor of the Marshalls and three against. One pro-Marshall brief stood out. It was filed by the National Black Chamber of Commerce and written by a high-powered pair of Washington lawyers, Democrat Lanny Davis and Republican David B. Rivkin. The brief was accompanied by press releases, a joint op-ed and a flurry of news coverage.\n\nAs required by court rules, the lawyers said in a footnote that no one paid the chamber for its participation. But in separate statements to Bloomberg News, each said he never asked the group if it was being paid.\n\nDavis said he got involved when Preston Marshall asked him to represent the chamber. He said the group’s founder and president, Harry Alford, later told him that “a number of my members” were interested in the case and that he could pay the legal fees upfront. Davis said the lawyers’ combined bill was probably less than $100,000.\n\n“If I’d suspected anything, I would have pursued more questions,” Davis said. “I was not willfully closing my eyes.”\n\nRivkin, a partner at Baker \u0026 Hostetler LLP in Washington, has represented the chamber several times.\n\n“If somebody hires me tomorrow to write an amicus brief and pays us for it, I’m not going to ask them if they got paid by someone else,” he said. “It’s not a question you ask your client.”\n\nAlford declined to comment. His group frequently champions causes that overlap with DCI’s client list and accepts donations from the firm’s corporate clients.\n\nAt the least, DCI played a behind-the-scenes role to promote the brief. A chamber media release was drafted by a DCI employee, according to data attached to an online version of the document.\n\nRecruiting Allies\n\nDCI is a leading player in the business of recruiting allies to advocate for a client’s policy goals. Founded in 1996 by three tobacco-industry operatives who honed their skills creating smokers’ rights groups, it has worked for some of the nation’s largest companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and AT\u0026T Inc. More recently, DCI has helped hedge fund managers who own Puerto Rican debt and Fannie Mae shares push for government policies that would make their bets pay off.\n\nIn the end, the high court ruled 5-4 in the Marshalls’ favor. But not long after their victory, they were back in court.\n\nThe Marshalls had waited more than a decade, while they fought with Smith, to pay the gift tax on a transfer of his holdings in Koch Industries that the billionaire made before he died. (The Marshalls’ stake in Koch is now estimated to be worth about $15 billion.) The delay led to a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over how much interest was owed. The sides were $75 million apart when the case reached the Fifth Circuit in 2012.\n\nThat’s when more friends of the court appeared. One brief was submitted on behalf of several conservative nonprofit groups, including the National Black Chamber. Another came from the Tax Foundation and a group of law professors including Steven Willis at the University of Florida’s Levin College of Law.\n\nWillis said in an interview that he was offered $1,500 by a man who claimed to be working for the Tax Foundation, an influential Washington nonprofit. Willis said he agreed to help write the brief because he believed the IRS’s position was wrong. He said he didn’t want the money, directing it to a student group he oversees.\n\nA payment to Willis from the Tax Foundation wouldn’t have to be disclosed because their names were both on the brief. But the foundation said it had nothing to do with recruiting other amici. And only after Bloomberg News obtained a copy of the check from the university did Willis learn that it didn’t come from the Tax Foundation but from a different nonprofit, the tiny Frontiers of Freedom Foundation with an address at a UPS Store in Virginia. The payment wasn’t disclosed to the court.\n\nGeorge Landrith, the foundation official who signed the check, said he couldn’t remember many details but that neither the Marshalls nor DCI reimbursed him.\n\nHistorically Black Schools\n\nWhile Willis was being recruited in Florida, a similar scenario was playing out at Johnson C. Smith University, a historically black school in Charlotte, North Carolina. This time, the pitch was from Eva Clayton, a graduate who had served a decade in Congress as the first black person elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from the state since 1898.\n\nClayton, who now works as a government-relations consultant, offered the school money if it agreed to file a brief supporting the Marshalls, according to a person with knowledge of the pitch who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nA brief from historically black schools could be expected to get a sympathetic hearing at the Fifth Circuit. Carl Stewart, who had just been elevated to chief justice, grew up in segregated Louisiana and graduated from a historically black university.\n\nClayton told school officials to follow up with a DCI executive named Monique Hall, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Hall, whose LinkedIn profile says she helps manage DCI’s relationships with nonprofits, was once named the National Black Chamber’s “partner of the year.”\n\nAfter Clayton’s pitch, Johnson C. Smith agreed to put its name on the brief and, in April 2013, began recruiting co-signers. A few days later, an aide to Ronald Carter, the university’s president, emailed a list of four schools to Suzanne McDowell, the lawyer drafting the brief. The email, which McDowell provided to Bloomberg News, includes the names of the presidents at each school who purportedly agreed to take part.\n\nClayton acknowledged in an email that she recruited her alma mater but said “there was no commitment of a donation.” She said she believes the school agreed to take part because of the merits of the brief’s argument.\n\nJohnson C. Smith’s annual report for the 2012-2013 academic year lists DCI as a member of its “prestigious five-star circle,” indicating a donation of between $25,000 and $49,999.\n\nCarter referred questions to Sherri Belfield, the school’s director of communications. She confirmed that Johnson C. Smith agreed to sponsor the brief but wouldn’t answer other questions.\n\nDCI’s Stevens said in an interview that the firm never paid any friends of the court in the Marshall cases. “We follow the strict letter and spirit of all federal and state laws,” he wrote in a subsequent email, declining to discuss the Johnson C. Smith donation. He said Hall declined to comment.\n\n\"DCI Group is proud of our role getting people and groups engaged in the democratic process by alerting them to issues and opportunities that directly affect them or the people they represent,\" Stevens said in the email.\n\nThe list sent to McDowell, co-chair of the tax-exempt organizations practice at Steptoe \u0026 Johnson LLP in Washington, included Olah at the now co-ed Barber-Scotia, who said he’d never heard of the case; Esther Terry, then president of Bennett College in Greensboro, North Carolina, who said, “I’m sure we didn’t sign any such thing”; and Elaine Copeland, of South Carolina's Clinton College.\n\n“Clinton College would not care how much a wealthy owner was charged for gift tax,” Copeland said. “If it had something to do with integration, or something to do with our funds from the federal government—maybe. But we were not involved in it at all.”\n\nFive other current or former officials at the three schools gave similar accounts. None of them could recall being asked to participate, let alone agreeing to do so.\n\nThe fourth president was Patricia Hardaway, former head of Wilberforce University in Ohio. In an interview in March, Hardaway also said she didn’t recall anything about a brief. Two weeks later, she changed her story, saying Carter phoned her and convinced her that she’d given her consent and then forgotten about it.\n\n“I don’t remember it specifically,” Hardaway said in the second interview, but “I just trust him in a way that I don’t believe he would fabricate that.”\n\nThe brief filed by McDowell says in a disclosure required by court rules that none of the schools was paid for its participation. McDowell said she relied on Johnson C. Smith for that information, as well as for the list of co-signers.\n\n‘Devastating Effect’\n\nThe Marshalls’ case hinged on how much interest on unpaid gift taxes the IRS can seek from the recipient of the gift. In her brief, McDowell argued that a victory for the IRS could have a “devastating effect” on charities like the five schools because they could find themselves on the hook for an unlimited amount of interest on a donor’s debts to the IRS. She didn’t give any examples of when that’s ever happened.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit assigned three judges to hear the case, Chief Justice Stewart not among them. They handed the family a 2-1 victory in 2015, allowing them to hang on to the disputed $75 million. The judges didn’t mention the amicus briefs in their decision. But in an earlier ruling, one of them said she found the three pro-Marshall briefs “persuasive.”\n\nAmong the school officials surprised to learn they’d helped a wealthy family beat the IRS was Edward Best, a retired United Methodist pastor in Georgia. At the time the brief was filed, he was executive chairman of Barber-Scotia’s board, desperately seeking a donor to solve the school’s money problems. He’s still trying.\n\n“If you happen to run across anybody that wants to give some money, let me know,” he said. “Honest money.”","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-13T09:00:00.000Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-anna-nicole-smith-billionaire-in-laws-court-lobbying/img/2017-anna-nicole-smith-billionaire-in-laws-court-lobbying-facebook.png","digest":"NJEw+C2849iLwfspmJa0wA==\n"}

Nonetheless, in the past three years unions have organized 5,000 people who work on Valley campuses. Among others, they’ve unionized shuttle drivers at Apple, Tesla, Twitter, LinkedIn, EBay, Salesforce.com, Yahoo!, Cisco, and Facebook; security guards at Adobe, IBM, Cisco, and Facebook; and cafeteria workers at Cisco, Intel, and, earlier this summer, Facebook.\n\nThe workers aren’t technically employed by any of those companies. Like many businesses, Valley giants hire contractors that typically offer much less in the way of pay and benefits than the tech companies’ direct employees get. Among other things, such arrangements help companies distance themselves from the way their cafeteria workers and security guards are treated, because somebody else is cutting the checks. Silicon Valley Rising, a coalition of unions and civil rights, community, and clergy groups heading the organizing campaign, says its successes have come largely from puncturing that veneer of plausible deniability.\n\nThat means directing political pressure, media scrutiny, and protests toward the tech companies themselves. “Everybody knows that the contractors will do what the tech companies say, so we’re focused on the big guys,” says Ben Field, a co-founder of the coalition who heads the AFL-CIO’s South Bay Labor Council. Labor leaders say their efforts have gotten some tech companies to cut ties with an anti-union contractor, intervene with others to ease unionization drives, and subsidize better pay for contract workers.\n\n“If you want to get people to buy your product, you don’t want them to feel that buying your product is contributing to the evils of the world,” says Silicon Valley Rising co-founder Derecka Mehrens, who directs Working Partnerships USA, a California nonprofit that advocates for workers. Tech companies have been image-conscious and closely watched of late, she says, and the coalition is “being opportunistic.”\n\nThe first such recent effort, in 2014, unionized 87 Facebook Inc. shuttle drivers employed by contractor Loop Transportation Inc. “We won by beating up Facebook, not beating up Loop,” says California Teamster leader Rome Aloise. Initially, Loop resisted recognizing the union, citing Facebook’s opposition, according to Aloise. So the Teamsters forced a vote by the drivers that was supervised by the National Labor Relations Board (the union won); union activists drew media attention to stories of Facebook shuttle drivers sleeping in their cars between grueling split shifts. “We got press in Japan and Germany and all over the world by saying Facebook,” Aloise says. “Nobody would’ve given a shit if I was saying Loop.”\n\nEventually, Facebook says, it OK’d proposed terms of the contract, which hiked drivers’ average pay by half, to $27.50 an hour, and for the first time provided fully paid family health care. Facebook also agreed to cover Loop’s added costs. Loop signed the contract. It didn’t respond to requests for comment, but Facebook denies discouraging unionization. “Our vendor workers are valued members of our community,” Facebook said in a statement. A spokeswoman says collective bargaining is up to contractors and their employees, but notes that since 2015, Facebook has required contractors to provide anyone doing “a substantial amount of work” for the company an hourly wage of at least $15 and three weeks of paid time off.\n\nWhen more than 500 cafeteria workers employed by Flagship Facility Services sought this year to join the union Unite Here!, Facebook says it didn’t direct Flagship’s handling of the situation. But it made clear to the contractor that Facebook would be neutral toward the organizing campaign and wouldn’t punish Flagship if the workers unionized, the spokeswoman says. Like Facebook, Flagship took a neutral position, and the workers joined the union in July.\n\nWhere possible, Silicon Valley Rising has pushed for policies that would more broadly strengthen labor’s position. In San Francisco the coalition persuaded the city transit authority to make it easier to deny permits to companies facing labor strife. In Santa Clara, where Intel Corp.’s unionized cafeteria staff had lost their jobs after the company brought in a new nonunion contractor, the coalition led the passage of a municipal law designed to avert such situations. The ordinance requires that new building service or food service contractors retain the old contractor’s employees for at least 90 days. After protests outside Intel’s headquarters, the cafeteria workers unionized again in an election last year. According to Unite Here, Intel and its contractor didn’t campaign against the union in the lead-up to the vote. Intel declined to comment.\n\nThe Valley campaign resembles a 1990s-era push by the Service Employees International Union to organize tens of thousands of janitors who were technically employed by building management companies. Apple Inc. was a prime target—the campaign included a hunger strike, a boycott, and a full-page ad in the New York Times—and workers there unionized after the contractor dropped its opposition to the union, presumably with Apple’s blessing. That offered a model for SEIU’s organizing of other tech janitors and, more recently, the Valley’s security guards.\n\nTech companies are open to such outcomes partly because contracted service staff represent a tiny share of their overall costs, says former SEIU leader Stephen Lerner, who led the ’90s campaign. It’s much less threatening to a company to have outside contractors unionize, he says, than it would be to let, say, Facebook engineers do so. David Huerta, president of one of SEIU’s California locals, says organizing among direct employees is a longer-term possibility.\n\nUnion critics say tech companies will come to regret intruding on contractors’ labor relations. “The fact that they have to browbeat employers or subcontractors into taking away rights from workers shows that the union business model is failing,” says F. Vincent Vernuccio, a fellow at free-market think tank Mackinac Center for Public Policy who served on President Trump’s transition team.\n\nLeaders of Silicon Valley Rising say they’ll support any workers who want to organize. Their near-term challenge is establishing a role for organized labor in Google Inc.’s massive planned expansion in San Jose. The city has voted to negotiate exclusively with Google on the sale of land for a new campus, and organizers want any deal to include provisions addressing such issues as affordable housing and the creation of quality jobs for local residents. “We expect our contractors to treat their employees well and we choose partners who do so,” Google spokesman Ty Sheppard said in an emailed statement. “We’ll be collaborating closely with city officials and community members as part of the public approval process.”\n\nOn Aug. 24, Silicon Valley Rising hosted a forum for San Jose residents to air their concerns and demands. As English-, Spanish-, and Vietnamese-speaking attendees broke into groups to brainstorm, an official from the city manager’s office circulated through the crowd to listen. When the crowd reconvened, Andrew Barney, a former Intel cafeteria worker, drew cheers and applause when he said, “I think Google should pay the residents of this community for being allowed to squat in our backyard.”\n\n“Google’s vulnerable right now with all this building and everything they’re doing, and they need a lot of approvals,” says the Teamsters’ Aloise. “We may just pick one, one time, to get involved, and see if we can stop it and have them come to us and say, ‘What do you need?’ ”","author":"Josh Eidelson","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-14T10:00:07.254Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQHjXOqBetus/v0/1200x630.jpg","digest":"afLm+4KcjBeOg7AVu7ymTA==\n"}

But Trump's temper -- honed over years as a public and political persona -- hasn't waned.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions bore the brunt of Trump's most recently disclosed upbraiding. The New York Times reported this week that Trump, in front of multiple people, called his long-time supporter an \"idiot.\"\n\nIn the West Wing, Trump can be a temperamental commander-in-chief, prone to bursts of anger that dissipate as quickly as they came on. The rage is an extension of what many say they experienced on the campaign trail.\n\nSome close to him even say his expressions of anger are a sign that he is engaged.\n\n\"I would much rather have him yell at me than be dismissive,\" said a source familiar with his management style. \"If he doesn't get mad, it means he doesn't care.\"\n\nPeople who have been in meetings with the President describe a pattern for Trump's outbursts.

Fighting back rarely ends well, since there are few topics Trump won't broach in his humiliating takedowns.\n\nHe enjoys swearing, one source said, especially when he is around people he is comfortable with like his longtime aides and family. But he tries to avoid it with people who don't know him well.\n\nHis preferred curse word, multiple people say: The tried-and-true F-bomb.\n\n'Volcanic' temper\n\nOne person who has been in meetings with Trump recalls the President displaying his \"volcanic\" temper when he \"feels ganged up on\" or when nobody tells him one of his ideas is good.\n\nThe tirades have, at times, left his staff shaken. After an angry phone call with the Australian prime minister in January, some of his staff were left white-faced after catching a first glimpse of his capacity for rage.\n\nEven as his temper has left some with memorable stories, those who have been in the room with Trump describe a man who quickly moves on.\n\n\"He has a temper, yes, and it doesn't take much to set him off, but at the same time, it is always overblown and he will be fine five minutes later,\" said one person who had worked with Trump. \"He can be volcanic and then he will be fine five minutes later.\"\n\nAnother source acknowledged that Trump had regular blow-ups during the campaign, but that they were more surprised by times when then-candidate held back.\n\n\"It was a pretty rare thing,\" the source said. \"There were a lot of times on the campaign trail where he didn't get mad but if he had, nobody would have blamed him.\"\n\n\"President Trump goes out of his way to care for his staff and has throughout his career,\" a White House official said. \"The relationships he has built and maintained are a testament to his leadership and his thoughtful approach. He looks out for his people and they look out for him.\"\n\nTrump isn't averse to acts of kindness. Valet attendants at his Florida golf clubs say he has arrived on slow nights, when tips are scarce, to hand over $100 bills. Staff at the White House residence largely describe Trump as a pleasant, if mercurial, man to work for. And many of Trump's longest tenured advisers, men and women who have worked with him for two decades or more, remain loyal to him because they believe that loyalty is reciprocated.\n\nBut as Trump developed an outsized persona as a real estate developer and later as a television celebrity, it wasn't kindness that formed his reputation. It was anger in all its shades: the fury-filled executive, the high-maintenance billionaire, the pugnacious Twitter troll.\n\nAs Trump rants and raves through his first eight months in office, his penchant for outbursts has persisted. The isolation of the White House, paired with the enveloping cloud of the Russia investigations, have caused Trump to brood and bellow with unpredictable results.\n\nOutbursts at his most loyal underlings have become commonplace. Multiple men of distinction, with long careers in public service, say the dressings-down that have sprung from Trump's lips are the most demeaning they've enduring in their adult lives.\n\nTraveling in Arizona last month, Trump lashed out at his chief of staff John Kelly, trashing the retired Marine Corps general for suggesting the President tone down his heated political rhetoric when discussing policy matters. Before the same event, an irate Trump phoned his longtime advance man George Gigicos to complain the crowds at the rally looked sparse on television.\n\nThree months earlier, it was Sessions at the end of Trump's fury firehose. Debasing him recusing himself from Russia-related matters, the President's tirade prompted Sessions to draft a resignation letter (Trump didn't accept).\n\nHumiliation\n\nThe list of top officials that Trump has humiliated in front of other aides stretches on. He cut off and undermined his Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin during a meeting on the debt ceiling. He repeatedly and publicly accused his first chief of staff Reince Priebus of acting disloyal during last year's campaign. And he barred his first press secretary Sean Spicer from a meeting with the Pope, despite knowing of his long desire to meet the Pontiff.\n\nTrump is not the first president to have explosive outbursts in the White House -- \"You couldn't be around Bill Clinton very long without seeing him get angry,\" Clinton aide and senior CNN political analyst David Gergen has said. Multiple sources close to Trump, in an effort to tamp down on the President's outbursts, cast his anger as normal in a White House, noting that past presidents have displayed plenty of anger.\n\n\"I think he's a very even-keeled guy and a guy I've known for a while, so I don't see him as someone who goes into wild tantrums,\" said Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax and a Trump confidante. \"A lot of Americans like that about Donald Trump. He's not going to be a pretend guy. He's not going to say he likes something when he really doesn't.\"\n\n\"When Donald Trump calls someone an idiot, I think in the Trump lexicon that is almost actually not a bad thing. That could be a good thing,\" Ruddy added. \"Chuck Schumer was a clown, and he became a pal. Obviously, Jeff Sessions wasn't so angry about it. He's still in his post. He kept his position.\"\n\nTrump himself has written that anger can be deployed as a tool as long as the actual emotions remain in check.\n\n\"Many people think I am an angry guy. But it's not true. I am tough and I am demanding, but I never lose it,\" he wrote in his 2007 book \"Think Big.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I use anger in a controlled way to make a point when I am negotiating,\" he wrote. \"In those situations, I am using anger for an effect, to further my goals. Using anger constructively is another form of mental toughness that you need to succeed.\"\n\nBut people who worked for Trump early in his career remember his temper showing more about him, not those he was fuming at.\n\nBarbara Res, Trump's former head of construction who worked with the then-businessman for 18 years, described the President a \"master\" at using anger to \"find the weakness in people and then exploit it to his benefit.\"\n\nRes recalled a number of moments where Trump dressed down employees in front of their colleagues, but it was an inspection of The Plaza Hotel in the fall 1989 that sticks out to her most.\n\nAfter fuming over the reviled armoire, Trump and Res moved onto the renovated bathroom, where the construction manager -- with the help of Trump's first wife, Ivana -- was installing cheaper green Chinese marble that the businessman had approved. He quickly flew into a rage.\n\n\"He started screaming, 'this is cheap shit. This is no good. You are making me look bad,'\" Res recalled. \"He is cruel and vicious and he undercuts. If he sees a weakness, he will pounce on it.\"\n\n\"That was his thing,\" she said. \"He cut your heart out.\"","author":"Dan Merica and Kevin Liptak, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T14:14:11.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160317091139-trump-angry-tease-super-tease.jpg","digest":"a3WoCe3ax76ZHy8q6t693g==\n"}

We walked all over Florida, we walked all over Texas, and they're loving Melania.\"\n\nTrump was of course referring to the visits he and Melania Trump made to Texas in the wake of Hurricane Harvey and to Florida earlier Thursday to survey damage from Hurricane Irma.\n\nMelania Trump's time as first lady has been punctuated by her quiet nature and wardrobe choices that get the town talking. But after a low-key summer, it looks like the first lady's fall will usher in a new phase of public life -- one in which she emerges more and likely formally adopts an East Wing agenda.\n\nTrump's aftermath-viewing wardrobe made headlines each time she stepped out of the White House and onto the South Lawn, and again from Air Force One to the tarmac -- from her footwear to her perfect ponytails, the first lady came under the harsh visual scrutiny she often does.\n\nIn lieu of remarks, her appearance is all the world has to go on, which can make where one stands on the topic of four-inch heels a heated political discussion.\n\nThe Thursday dinner came toward the end of a comparatively busy couple of weeks for Melania Trump, who had kept a low-profile over the summer. In July and August, she spent her time at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, or quietly prepping the White House after officially moving in mid-June.\n\nThere was a visit to Poland in July, where she gave introductory remarks for her husband's speech in Warsaw; then jetted with him to the G20 summit in Germany for a handful of spousal events. She wowed the fashion world on her final night there, wearing a white, fringed Michael Kors dress while sitting next to Russian President Vladimir Putin for a closing dinner. Again, her fashion was speaking for her.\n\nThen it was off to Paris in mid-July to celebrate Bastille Day, where again, Trump was a silent observer, sightseeing with French first lady Brigitte Macron and watching the parade along the Champs-Élysées. A quick pop on an open mic caught her greeting children at a Paris hospital in their native tongue. It was a fleeting moment, though she stayed a bit to play and interact with the kids, smiling warmly.\n\nFor most of the past few months, the American public has only had those tiny clues to figure out their first lady, whose schedule of official speaking engagements has been light since her husband took office in January.\n\n\"She is a woman of few words,\" Anita McBride, who served as Laura Bush's chief of staff during the George W. Bush administration, said of Melania Trump. \"But when she says something, it really is gentle and meaningful, and soothing -- it has a natural empathy to it.\"\n\nMcBride says Trump's quiet nature reminds her of Mrs. Bush in that \"when she she did say something, it mattered.\"\n\n\"We haven't had a first lady this shy and reserved since Bess Truman,\" said Kate Andersen Brower, a CNN contributor and author of \"First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies.\"\n\n\"Bess avoided Washington as much as possible and preferred their modest home in Independence, Missouri. She hated talking to the press and she said she was just 'the President's wife and the mother of his daughter,' Brower said.\n\nTrump likely understands the importance of her role, but the time it's taken for her to get to know the public, and vice versa, displays an independent streak.\n\n\"I've been told that she's very self-assured and doesn't feel like she needs to change her reserved personality to be more relatable,\" said Brower. \"She doesn't seem to care about pleasing people. I think the poll numbers show that many people actually like the self confidence that she exudes.\"\n\nSummertime\n\nYet summertime at the White House was unnaturally slow this year, given that a much-needed overhaul of the West Wing and parts of the East Wing took place for two weeks in August, forcing the first family to stay away in Bedminster.\n\nThe Executive Residence staff never really stops, however, even when the family is gone, according to Stephen Rochon, its former director and chief usher under both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\n\"Whenever the first families left on summer vacations, or any times during the year, is when the residence staff did many of renovations on the public and private floors of the mansion, such as painting, decorating, changing out furniture, etc,\" Rochon said.\n\nThe smaller footprint of Trump's entertaining schedule, with the exception of dignitary visits, coupled with the renovations, meant an even less visible first lady.\n\n\"The summer has been slow,\" said McBride, \"but from a historical perspective it's not out of character.\"\n\n\"The first lady has had a very busy summer moving her family into the White House, preparing her son for a new school and making the preparations necessary in undertaking her role as first lady,\" Melania Trump's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, told CNN. \"She has been using the summer months to educate herself more fully about the issues involved in the initiatives she plans to undertake.\"\n\nGrisham added the first lady's sojourn at Bedminster also included work, saying, \"Mrs. Trump attended meetings that the President hosted, in order to understand certain initiatives that she wishes to support in her own way.\"\n\nChampioning a cause\n\nTrump has yet to formally announce her platform as first lady, something Michelle Obama didn't do until November of her husband's first year as President. But aides say it's coming \"soon.\"\n\nAll clues indicate that she intends to focus on children, women and families, borne out of the few hints at rare public appearances.\n\nOn Friday afternoon she accompanied the President on a visit to Maryland's Joint Base Andrews, breaking off on her own to pop by a gymnasium, where she spent time with children, coloring and passing out crayons, and then throwing a few paper airplanes as part of a flying experiment, testing STEM projects.\n\nTrump seems most comfortable around young people; she's done the most smiling when around children, whether visiting a hospital or school or hosting families at the White House, where she hoisted a baby in her arms at the congressional picnic in June.\n\n\"Michelle Obama was visible early in her tenure in other ways, before establishing her platform,\" said McBride, noting the differences between Obama and Trump. \"She was quick to build a relationship and connection with the American people with fashion and sense of style, and that's something that helped her become visible. Every first lady is different, and we knew early on that Melania wasn't going to be that way, especially since her first pronouncement was that she wouldn't be living in the White House until several months after Inauguration.\"\n\nBy opening with the point that people wouldn't be seeing her much right away, Trump actually spared herself the difficult job of announcing plans too soon, and falling short of expectation.\n\n\"She set the bar low for how and when she would engage,\" added McBride.\n\nGrisham said the moment of that engagement is almost at hand.\n\n\"When the time is right, and the resources and support are available, Mrs. Trump will officially announce her initiatives,\" Grisham said. \"The first lady is working diligently in an effort to be fully prepared, with the necessary infrastructure before she presents her causes to the world.\"\n\nAs for critics who are waiting for her to step up to something, Grisham is quick to point out this isn't a woman who cares what people are saying about her.\n\n\"Mrs. Trump will never fit into a mold and is not concerned about the comparisons often made of her,\" Grisham told CNN. \"The first lady wishes to make a difference in our country and hopes that regardless of political affiliation, everyone will realize she is her own individual.\"\n\nFinding her voice\n\nBy the time the first week of September was over, Trump had put Barron Trump, 11, into a new school, St. Andrew's in Potomac, Maryland, and it appeared she'd started to turn her sights to a more public life.\n\nHer words of support, often in the form of tweets, were a calming and constant occurrence during tumultuous times, from Charlottesville's race riots to the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nTrump took to Twitter most times before her husband, something Grisham said wasn't an issue for her, or him.\n\n\"Mrs. Trump is a independent woman and will always stay true to herself,\" she said. \"She has her own thoughts and opinions and shares them honestly and openly on social media, and in the presence of others.\"\n\nMcBride said Trump's personal story is something she could use to help unite the country, and she wishes she'd speak out about it more.\n\n\"We have seen her be warm, especially with children,\" she said. \"There's an instinctive deference when you're with the president, that does come inherently. But I'm awed by the American experiment and the American dream that a woman who has been a citizen for 10 years is now first lady.\"\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump said a thick skin was imperative to survive the rough and tumble world of politics, and she appears to have developed one, not bowing to pressure from fashion magazine editorials to swap out her spiky stilettos, or stick solely to American designers.\n\n\"She does not concern herself with what the media and critics have to say about her appearance,\" said Grisham.\n\nStanding beside her husband in the Oval Office on September 1 as he thanked aid groups after Hurricane Harvey, Trump spoke publicly on camera for the first time in weeks.\n\n\"It's great to be here with these amazing people,\" she said. \"And I want to thank all of the volunteers, all across the country, that came to help, to Texas. Fantastic job, we're going tomorrow, to visit them and I just want to tell them to be strong and everything will be OK.\"\n\nHer husband apparently hadn't told her ahead of time that he wanted her to speak, and appeared impressed with her improvisation.\n\n\"See, I didn't tell her I was going to do that, and she did a great job,\" the President said.\n\nBack in Texas the following day, in $50 Converse sneakers and a TEXAS-emblazoned baseball cap, Melania Trump comforted children in a shelter, and handed out supplies, looking on as her husband encouraged volunteers at a church and received updates from state representatives.\n\nIn Florida this week, she did much of the same, only in white Converse and white cap, operating as silent, but strong, partner to her husband -- being the quiet calm to his bravado.\n\nThe weekend before, Trump played hostess to Cabinet spouses during a working weekend at Camp David, and, the following day, she stood stoically once again at the side of the President for the 9/11 remembrance ceremonies.\n\nBy Thursday night's dinner for the White House Historical Association, after Trump's introduction, the first lady appeared to relish the opportunity to speak publicly to her guests, talking about how touched she was by the people she had met in Texas and Florida.\n\n\"I have seen the true spirit of this nation, an unwavering commitment to overcome,\" she said, according to a copy of her speech obtained by CNN.\n\nShe nodded in her remarks to another quiet first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, who started the association in 1961.\n\n\"She was comfortable and at home, elegant and graceful -- she glided through that dinner, all smiles,\" one dinner guest told CNN.\n\nTrump herself said that she's warming to the White House, in her remarks adding, \"Our family's appreciation for this home grows each and every day.\"\n\nTrump's comfort at the lectern will be tested at least twice more this month. Next week, she heads to New York for the United Nations General Assembly where she will host a luncheon and make remarks, Grisham confirmed to CNN.\n\nAnd on September 23, she makes her first solo international trip. She's scheduled to go to Canada to co-host the kickoff of the Invictus Games, a charity started by Britain's Prince Harry, who will also be in attendance.","author":"Kate Bennett, CNN's COVER/LINE","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T20:01:32.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170915173059-01-melania-trump-2017-super-tease.jpg","digest":"xvJs38RdpfNo725eP/5NUg==\n"}

See Hurricane Irma's impact on the Caribbean Hide Caption 58 of 58\n\nPeople on the west coast, where Hurricane Irma made landfall September 10, will likely have power restored by Friday, according to Florida Power \u0026 Light Co.\n\nCustomers who lost electricity on Florida's eastern side will likely have it restored by this weekend, because fewer utility poles came down there, the company said.\n\nUpper Keys bouncing back more quickly\n\nRecovery is only getting started, and some places remain flooded. Utility companies are working to restore power to the battered Keys.\n\nThe Upper Keys, which include Key Largo, Tavernier and Islamorada, have started to bounce back more quickly than the Middle and Lower Keys, likely owing to their distance from Irma's eye and proximity to the mainland.\n\nSeventy percent of critical facilities have power in the Upper Keys as of Saturday afternoon, according to the Florida Keys Electric Cooperative Association, which provides service from Key Largo to Marathon. These include hospitals, key government buildings, schools, sewer facilities, water pumping stations and grocery stores.\n\nFarther down the island chain, utilities and communications remain spotty or nonexistent.\n\nMore than 14,000 out 16,000-plus customers were without power in the Lower Keys on Saturday afternoon, according to Keys Energy Services, which provides service from Big Pine Key to Key West. Florida Power \u0026 Light serves less than 100 customers in the Keys, reporting only 10 there remain without power.\n\nA home left in ruins Wednesday in Big Pine Key shows how the Florida Keys bore the brunt of Irma.\n\nPower outages hit other Southeastern states as the storm moved north, including Georgia.\n\nIn Big Pine Key, about 10 miles east of where Category 4 Irma made landfall in Cudjoe Key, the devastation was widespread, and no structure was left untouched. The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates that 25% of homes in the Keys were destroyed.\n\nDuring meetings with officials Friday in the Keys, Gov. Rick Scott said he understands the frustration of residents but cautioned they could not return until it was safe.\n\n\"You want to come back to power,\" he said. \"You want to come back to a sewer system that works. You want to come back to a water system that works. You want to come back to where you have the food you need.\"\n\nThe tail end of the archipelago, from Key West eastward to Big Coppitt Key, appears to have fared better than the Middle Keys.\n\n\"The challenge, I think, for us will be ... between here and Marathon,\" Key West City Manager Jim Scholl said. \"It's going to be tough for returning residents because there will be many displaced residents and we have to have a long-term shelter option.\"\n\nFrustration to return home\n\nIrma's furious march through Florida not only darkened millions of homes, it also flooded roads, piling them with debris and blocking off access to neighborhoods.\n\nBrice Barr, who owns a charter fishing boat business in Key West, said he would like to head back south.\n\nBarr and his wife fled to his parents' home in the northern Florida ahead of the storm, he told CNN affiliate WCJB , and are watching for their moment to return.\n\n\"Walking away from a boat -- that is one of my family's main source of income -- is very difficult to (do), especially when you secure all your property and everything else knowing that you may not see it again,\" Barr told the TV station this week.\n\nDeadly storm\n\nAt least 34 storm-related deaths have been reported on the US mainland, according to local officials. They include 27 in Florida, four in South Carolina and three in Georgia.\n\nThat number doesn't include eight deaths reported Wednesday at a nursing home in Hollywood, Florida, after it lost a transformer that powers the air conditioning. Police have said the deaths are under investigation.","author":"Ray Sanchez and Martin Savidge, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T18:30:54.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170913211839-irma-big-pine-key-home-super-tease.jpg","digest":"ItdNzB7CYCknu48GO1LoAw==\n"}

The case sparked accusations of foul play on social media.\n\nPolice in Rosemont, a suburb northwest of Chicago, said Kenneka Jenkins, 19, was last seen early Saturday, September 9, at a party at the Crowne Plaza Chicago O'Hare Hotel. Her family reported her missing later that day, and Jenkins' body was found in the walk-in freezer at the hotel shortly before 1 a.m. Sunday. The results of an autopsy by the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office are pending.\n\nSurveillance video from inside the Crowne Plaza, released by the Rosemont Public Safety Department and obtained by CNN, shows Jenkins staggering through the hotel's hallways early Saturday.\n\nKenneka Jenkins is shown here in this photo from Facebook.\n\nIn the footage, Jenkins is first seen walking through the hotel with several unidentified people around 1:13 a.m. on that Saturday. She appears to be steady.\n\nBut when Jenkins is next sighted exiting an elevator at 3:25 a.m., she is alone and visibly impaired, and staggers out of the elevator, briefly leaning on the wall for support before heading down the hallway.\n\nSurveillance cameras next catch Jenkins in hallways at 3:27 and 3:29 a.m., also alone. She struggles to head in one direction, and nearly falls over several times, but catches herself.\n\nThe last clip shows Jenkins stumbling through the hotel kitchen, which appears to be empty. She walks out of view of the cameras at 3:32 a.m., the last time she was seen before her body was found in the hotel's walk-in freezer.\n\nPolice say they have 36 hours of surveillance video from that weekend and have publicly released all clips in which Jenkins can be seen.\n\nAt no point in the footage provided to CNN can Jenkins be seen walking into the freezer.\n\nAndrew Holmes, a community activist who said he is working with Jenkins' family, said Thursday that Rosemont police showed him surveillance video of the young woman walking into the freezer in the hotel basement on her own.\n\nHolmes told CNN affiliate WBBM Jenkins appeared to be lost and tried several doors to get upstairs to the hotel lobby before she walked into the freezer, located in an unsecure area.\n\n\"We all wanted to know: Did anybody pull her down there? Did anybody force her down there? Was anybody on the other side in that room when she got down there? And the answer to that is no,\" Holmes told WBBM.\n\nHolmes urged anyone with evidence in the case to contact police and stop making accusations on social media.\n\n\"Just don't put it out there on Facebook because if you put it out there, then be prepared to answer what you put out there,\" Holmes told WBBM.\n\nWhen her friends realized Jenkins was missing, they notified her mother, Tereasa Martin. In recordings of 911 calls released by the police and obtained by CNN, Martin said the friends her daughter was with had gone upstairs to find a phone and left Jenkins in the hotel's lobby.\n\nWhen they came back, Martin said, Jenkins was gone. Martin told the police dispatcher that her daughter's friends said she drank \"one cup\" but that \"one cup is too much for her,\" Martin said.\n\nPolice: 'Not ruling out anything'\n\nIn a news release, the Rosemont Public Safety Department said it was publicly disclosing all the video surveillance from the Crowne Plaza Hotel that showed Jenkins the night of her disappearance. Jenkins' family has seen the surveillance video, the release said.\n\nRosemont police spokesman Detective Joe Balogh said Holmes was shown portions of the surveillance footage, in the hope that he could help with the investigation, but Balogh declined to confirm Holmes' account of the video.\n\n\"On our end, we're not ruling out anything but we are using that footage to try and pinpoint what happened,\" Balogh told CNN.\n\nRosemont police said in a statement they have interviewed and located a dozen people \"who were involved in some way,\" including eight who were at the party. Police were looking for four others.\n\nPolice said they are also combing through hours of footage from 47 hotel cameras. Technicians were also looking at videos related to the investigation.\n\nBalogh told CNN that authorities also handed over the video to an attorney for Jenkins' mother and to the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office.\n\nMartin and her attorneys said at a news conference Friday they had seen \"snippets\" of surveillance video, but had not seen all of it.\n\n\"I thank everybody for your help, the love and support,\" Martin said. \"But I also want to know what happened. I want to see all -- I want to see her actually walking into this freezer and closing herself within this freezer and freezing to death.\"\n\nHotel offers to pay for funeral\n\nIn the news conference, Jenkins' mother and her attorneys were critical of the hotel's response.\n\nMartin, the attorneys said, called the hotel and went there early Saturday to ask them to review surveillance footage to find her daughter.\n\n\"They never checked. They never searched,\" said Sam Adams, one of Martin's lawyers. \"They never did anything while a young, 19-year-old disoriented girl is sitting in their freezer.\"\n\n\"Ms. Martin just wants to know what happened to her daughter,\" Larry Rogers, another lawyer for the Jenkins family, told CNN Saturday. \"We're just trying to see where the facts lead.\"\n\nWednesday, Jenkins' family and supporters gathered at the hotel demanding answers. They carried signs and chanted: \"Release the tapes.\"\n\nRosemont police said the hotel has cooperated with the investigation.\n\nAccording to WBBM, a hotel spokesman, Glenn Harston, said Jenkins' death was \"a tragic accident.\" He added that the freezer had latches on the inside and outside and did not lock.","author":"Darran Simon and Dakin Andone, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T21:24:49.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170916160952-02-chicago-freezer-death-super-tease.jpg","digest":"5M0HipVqYRYbyKzgRjAtKA==\n"}

A criminal investigation is underway by Hollywood police; officials with the facility said staff members are cooperating with it and other inquiries.\n\n\"The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills expresses its deepest sympathy to the family members of the residents who passed away following a prolonged outage of our air conditioning system due to Hurricane Irma,\" the nursing home said this week.\n\n\"We are devastated by these losses. We are fully cooperating with all authorities and regulators to assess what went wrong and to ensure our other residents are cared for.\"\n\nThe video gives a glimpse into some of the conditions inside the facility Tuesday night before a series of 911 calls brought firefighters to the facility, where three people were found dead on the second floor.\n\nIn the middle of the video, the camera moves into the hallway where a naked woman is hunched over on what appears to be a hospital bed.\n\nThe recording shows the facility had power but workers were using an industrial-size drum fan sitting in front of two closed doors to move air through a hallway.\n\nA spokesman for the nursing home told CNN that officials had not seen the video, and if they had they would be precluded by law from commenting on it.\n\nThe spokesman for the facility, Ron Bartlett, said that after the air conditioning stopped, workers continually gave residents water and ice.\n\nDuring Hurricane Irma on Sunday, a tree fell onto a transformer that powered the nursing home's air conditioning system, Broward County officials said Wednesday.\n\nIn all, 141 patients were evacuated from the facility. One resident died at the facility Tuesday but, because the patient had a do-not-resuscitate order, was sent to a funeral home before police asked for the body, according to police.\n\nQuestions arise\n\nAuthorities are now questioning how the conditions at the nursing home lasted for so long.\n\nNursing home administrator Jorge Carballo said this week the center immediately contacted Florida Power \u0026 Light and continued to follow up with the utility for status updates on when repairs to the transformer would be made. City and state officials said they were in contact with the nursing home for three days and advised them to call 911 if they believed that the health or safety of patients was at risk.\n\n\"When asked if they had any medical needs or emergencies, (the nursing home) did not request assistance or indicate any medical emergency existed,\" Broward County Mayor Barbara Sharief said in a statement.\n\nThe nursing home, in a timeline released this week, said it first called Florida Power \u0026 Light on Sunday afternoon about the power being out to the air conditioner and began using 10 portable units that day.\n\nJUST WATCHED Scene of nursing home deaths cited for past violations Replay More Videos ...

It said on Tuesday nursing home workers made repeated calls to FP\u0026L, which had not fixed the transformer. Workers at the facility got more portable air conditioners from a nearby hospital, the facility's timeline says.\n\nA spokesman for Scott's office, John Tupps, said \"every call made to the governor from facility management was referred to the Agency for Health Care Administration and the Florida Department of Health and quickly returned.\"\n\nThe Florida Department of Health and the Agency for Health Care Administration addressed the timeline Friday, saying, \"It is 100 percent the responsibility of health care professionals to preserve life by acting in the best interest of the health and well-being of their patients.\"\n\nRichard Beltran, a spokesman for Florida Power \u0026 Light, said Wednesday: \"What we know now is that a portion of the facility did, in fact, have power, that there was a hospital across the parking lot from this facility and that the nursing home was required to have a permanently installed operational generator.\"\n\nOn Friday, parent company NextEra Energy referred CNN to a statement on its website , that says, in part: \"Because of the current investigations associated with these tragic events involving the nursing home, we are limited in what we can say.\"\n\nThe nursing home has a history of safety violations and citations, including two for not following generator regulations in 2014 and 2016. In both instances, the nursing home corrected these deficiencies.\n\nFederal law currently requires that nursing homes be kept between 71 and 81 degrees and have a backup power source in case of emergency. That backup power must be able to keep temperatures in a safe range for nursing home residents and whatever provisions are stored there, according to more recent regulations that must be implemented by November 2017.\n\nThree agencies probing how it happened\n\nThe causes of the deaths for the residents, who ranged in ages from 71 to 99, are under investigation to see whether any of them were heat-related, said Raelin Storey, director of public affairs for the City of Hollywood.\n\n\"The initial investigation has determined that the facility's air conditioning system was not fully functional,\" the city of Hollywood, Florida, said in a statement. \"Portable A/C units were being used in the facility, but the facility was excessively hot.\"\n\nThe nursing home, which is housed in a two-story building, said it prepped for Hurricane Irma. The power generator was working, and the staff stocked up on seven days' worth of food and water. But they didn't anticipate they would still have to fight the intense heat with fans and portable air conditioner units.\n\nGov. Rick Scott ordered an emergency moratorium on Wednesday to prevent the facility from admitting new patients.\n\nThree agencies have launched investigations into how this happened, but many questions remain unanswered.\n\n\"I am going to aggressively demand answers on how this tragic event took place,\" Scott said in a statement. \"If they find that this facility was not meeting the state's high standards of care, they will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nWith a moratorium in place and an ongoing criminal investigation, the residents of Hollywood Hills will find new homes at other facilities, said Storey.\n\n\"That is a difficult proposition,\" she said. \"There are not as many beds and facilities available as there are people with needs.\"\n\n'I can't breathe.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bdac9803c1c0e548b2c0cd"},"description":"VICIS has created a new style of helmet that's designed to lessen the force of blows to the head. It's finally getting its chance to shine in the NFL.","title":"Vicis Zero1 NFL helmet aims to reduce head injuries","url":"http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/16/news/companies/vicis-nfl-helmet-concussions-safety/index.html","text":"Head injuries have plagued the NFL for years. But the helmets that players wear have retained roughly the same design since the 1970s.\n\nThis season, about 70 NFL players are wearing a new helmet that's a radical departure from previous iterations -- and, the league believes, safer.\n\nIt won't be easy to spot when you're watching games on Sunday. The Vicis Zero1 looks a lot like other helmets. But it's designed to soften the blows to the heads of NFL players.\n\nThe scientists, neurosurgeons and engineers who designed the helmet make clear that it won't prevent concussions. No helmet will. Houston Texans linebacker Brian Cushing, who wears the Vicis helmet, suffered a concussion during his team's first game of the season.\n\nBut the NFL and the NFL Players Association spent the last few years testing dozens of helmet concepts that could help protect players. Out of all the designs, the Vicis ranked highest in safety.\n\nIt works by offering four layers of protection. An outer layer compresses to absorb shock and then rebounds, the way a tennis ball deforms when it hits a solid surface and then returns to shape.\n\nBelow that is a layer of polymer columns that move in different directions to absorb shock and reduce force. A hard inner shell helps prevent skull fractures and brain bleeds. And a layer of memory foam provides comfort.\n\nThat makes the Vicis helmet, which sells for $1,500, markedly different from other helmets, most of which consist of a single layer of foam cushioning inside a hard plastic shell. Other models tested alongside the Vicis by the NFL and NFLPA feature these outer shells and various levels of cushioning.\n\nRelated: The NFL is back. Are you?\n\nAbout half of NFL teams placed orders for their players. (Individual players, not teams, decide which helmets to wear.) Players from the Seattle Seahawks, Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans are early adopters.\n\nJadeveon Clowney of the Houston Texans and Alex Smith of the Kansas City Chiefs will sport the new headgear this season. From the Seattle Seahawks, Russell Wilson, Richard Sherman and Doug Baldwin, who is also an investor in the company, will wear it, too.\n\n\"You don't feel the thuds as hard as they normally are,\" said Seahawks defensive end Cliff Avril, who is wearing the Vicis.\n\nChiefs center Mitch Morse said he's \"always looking to be progressive, especially regarding brain function and health, so for me, it was a pretty easy switch to make.\"\n\nRelated: CTE found in 99% of studied brains from deceased NFL players\n\nThe NFL and the broader sport have faced intense scrutiny over concussions.\n\nMedical experts, players and parents are concerned that repeated concussions increase the risk of a degenerative disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.\n\nA recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found CTE in 99% of the brains of deceased NFL players donated to scientific research.\n\nThe NFL has invested in preventing, diagnosing and treating head injuries. Last year it announced a $100 million concussion initiative aimed at making the game safer. The first $40 million was made available in August.\n\nThe league also launched the Head Health Challenge, a competition to encourage companies to study and develop products to improve player safety. Vicis was one of the winners and received a round of funding from the NFL. It has since raised $30 million on its own.\n\nAn NFL spokesperson told CNNMoney the league is \"optimistic\" that the Vicis helmet will be \"the first of many novel developments as we continue to stimulate research and innovation.\"\n\nRelated: Can this helmet make football safer?\n\nIn college football, players from Notre Dame, Middle Tennessee State and Michigan State plan to use the helmet this season.\n\nThe company also wants to sell it to children and high schoolers. It will be available online starting this fall. Vicis isn't saying what it will charge, only that the helmet will be cheaper than $1,500. It also plans to offer discounts.\n\nVicis cofounder and pediatric neurosurgeon Sam Browd said he doesn't want cost to keep any kid from using one.\n\n\"There's certainly going to be communities out there where a helmet, no matter what price point we come in at, is going to be maybe too expensive,\" he said. \"Whatever kids feel like they want to be in our helmet, and would think our helmet's safer, I'm going to make sure that they get the helmet.\"","author":"Ahiza Garcia","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T10:23:36.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160908091635-vicis-helmet-780x439.jpg","digest":"j6PWQ4uYBjKv0WL3TWoQLw==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"59bdaca303c1c0e548b2c0d2"},"description":"","title":"Jeff Jensen says goodbye to Entertainment Weekly","url":"http://ew.com/tv/2017/09/15/jeff-jensen-says-goodbye-to-entertainment-weekly/","text":"I got my job at Entertainment Weekly because of a fire drill.\n\nThe year was 1998. I was 28 and a reporter at Advertising Age, the place that gave me my start in journalism right out of college. I covered sports and entertainment marketing; I wrote a lot about basketball shoes. I was also an unapologetic geek, pop culture obsessive, and insufferable pretentious twit with a passion for comic books, TV, and prattling on about auteur theory to my friends. I was a Christian, but I’ve prayed as much to David Lynch as Jesus since Twin Peaks ascended into heaven in 1991. Dear Almighty Eraserhead, please dwell among us again…\n\nOkay, exaggerating. But I’m not kidding when I say that my Bible at the time was Entertainment Weekly, the curator of my cultural life, the pusher-man of pop addictions. Every Friday, I’d steal the new issue of EW from Michael Schneider’s mailbox, take an early lunch and read it cover to cover — and then return it without him ever knowing. One night, I found myself at a dinner party, sitting across the table from my favorite EW writer, Chris Nashawaty, listening to him talk about a piece he had done on the cultural significance of Godzilla. I burned with covetous envy. That sounded like my dream job. Feeling I had reached a crossroads in life, I decided to make the dream come true or get out of journalism. The other options: English professor, pastor, or open a single-screen indie theater with an adjoining bookstore/coffee bar. My soon-to-be fiancée, Amy — weighing possible futures for herself – strongly encouraged the EW idea.\n\nI sent clips to every editor and hoped one of them would call me. Maggie Murphy did. Soon, I was meeting with Mary Kaye Schilling to audition for the next act of my life. Fail and I was teaching Kakfa 101, attending seminary, or trying to convince a bank that I actually knew something about lattes. We were a couple minutes into the interview – barely beyond pleasantries – when the fire alarm went off. It was a drill. Everyone out of the building.\n\nMary Kaye and I joined other staffers in the hall. We tried to continue the interview (“So, who’s in your Rolodex?” “Uh, the head of publicity at Reebok?”), but it was awkward. Enter Dan Snierson, soon to be one of my best friends in the world. He was the last person to join the line because Dan Snierson is the hardest working person in entertainment journalism, the last man out every night. As we began walking down a stairwell to a street 17 floors below, Dan and Mary Kaye started talking about Fox’s Party of Five. I presented a face of attentive listening; privately, I was freaking. This interview was a train wreck.\n\nBut then Dan asked me what I watched. The X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I said. EW had been all over both shows — and Mary-Kaye had helped lead the way. A special edition of EW, a guide to The X-Files, was a Biblical text for me; Mary Kaye had edited it. Much geeking out ensued as we finished the descent and took the elevator back upstairs. By that time, Mary Kaye had to go to another appointment. I was sure I bombed. But a few weeks later, I was asked to interview with editor-in-chief Jim Seymore, and then I was hired. I was told that the thing that impressed her the most was how well I handled myself during that fire drill. Looking back, I can say something similar about the people I’ve worked with over the years. EW has been my Buffy. It has saved my world. A lot.\n\nMy first couple years at EW were exhilarating and overwhelming. Covering Oscar parties, Cannes, and Showest when it was still Showest. Writing filmographies on Milos Forman and Mike Nichols, a profile on Richard Farnsworth, an obit on Bob Kane. My first cover story was about The Haunting, the remake starring Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones. What I remember most is that it came out the weekend Amy and I got married. The first cover story I actually liked was about X-Men. A long interview with a young unknown named Hugh Jackman inside a Statue of Liberty gift shop set on a subzero day in Montreal remains a career highlight. We were two golly-gee-whiz guys making the most of a big break. This concludes the degree to which Hugh Jackman and I have ever had anything in common.\n\nMost of my early work at EW was edited by two of the greatest journalists I’ve ever known. Mark Harris pushed me to think better. Jess Cagle demanded I write better. One time, Jess sent back a small thing I did for a Fall Movie Preview with the following note: “This thing is so boring that my eyes rolled out the back of my head, down my back, and got lost with the loose change in my chair. Okay, it’s not that bad, but can you try again? Thx.” I printed this note out and tacked it above my computer where it inspired me for years.\n\nIf I improved, it was because of the example and push of the extraordinary writers on staff. Critics like Ken Tucker, Lisa Schwarzbaum, Owen Gleiberman, Gillian Flynn. Feature writers like Nashawaty, David Hochman, Chris Willman, Karen Valby, and the great Benjamin Svetkey. But first and foremost, there was Dan. Our offices were next to each other in the early days. We were always in each other’s offices, assessing and vetting prose, structure, jokes, and everything else. Tenacious D. Van Halen. My wild ideas for comic books. A game we used to play called “Tell me everything you know about [BLANK] in five minutes GO!” Those were the days. Now, we work too much. All of us.\n\nBut I wrote for so many editors, all of them smart, skilled and passionate professionals who invested a lot in me, including Albert Kim, Jeff Giles, Jay Woodruff, and Josh Wolk. Tina Jordan sent me to Scotland to interview J.K. Rowling on a train. Our TV editors – Mary Kaye, Jamie Bufalino, Kristen Baldwin, and Henry Goldblatt – put me on the Buffy beat. I went to the set to watch the Scooby Gang try to raise the Slayer from the dead. I visited the set of the finale, not long after writing a cover story in which Sarah Michelle Gellar announced she was quitting the series. Marc Bernardin tasked me with handling an oral history of the comic book masterpiece Watchmen. Rick Tetzeli challenged me beyond my comfort zone in various ways, like putting me on the videogame beat. Doug Brod guided Dan and me through the first of our many nutty endeavors together. I was assigned to cover the Spike Jonze/Charlie Kaufman film Adaptation. To capture the meta-trippy spirit of the film, we wrote a story about Dan writing about me trying and failing to write a story about Adaptation. Another fave, edited by Jill Bernstein, was a profile of my hero, David Lynch, timed to the release of Inland Empire, a project he financed by marketing a line of coffee. Jill’s headline was great: “David Lynch Wants To Get Into Your Bloodstream.”\n\nThe thrill of talking to artists about how they do what they do was sometimes mitigated by the requirement of inquiring about… other things. No assignment made me more anxious than interviewing Nicole Kidman about Moulin Rouge!, because it meant asking her about tabloid rumors concerning her recent divorce from Tom Cruise. I crapped liquid for a week leading up that conversation and hated myself for a while after it. A close second was interviewing Tom Cruise a couple months later about Vanilla Sky, for the same reason. More liquid crappage, more self-loathing. Nothing about this job really spooked me after that, except the time I interviewed Al Pacino and Meryl Streep, together, for HBO’s adaptation of Angels in America. Their combined suffer-no-fools intensity was so annihilating, actual angels had to be sent to glue me back together.\n\nThe first half of my EW tenure was spent mostly covering the new century Geek Pop revolution, and with it, Hollywood’s increasing embrace of franchise filmmaking. It was a nostalgia thrill for me: As I wrote in this personal essay, my sometimes criminal zeal for comic books pretty much made me who I am today. I saw Superman fly over The Daily Planet on a soundstage in Sydney, Spider-Man swing by a web through a studio in Los Angeles, Captain America jump onto a train outside London, Bruce Wayne limp through a Batcave in Studio City, and Hulk smash through Universal City… except the Hulk wasn’t really there, it was just a Hulk head on a stick carried around by a special effects guy. A memory to mirror Hugh Jackman: Sitting with Robert Downey Jr. in his trailer while filming Iron Man, a movie that sealed his comeback and transformed his career. “I remember running into Keanu after he got back from The Matrix, and he said, ‘Brother, it feels like I’ve been on another planet,'” Downey told me while smoking a cigar. “Well, I feel like I’m on Planet Iron Man. And it’s the greatest.” As pop culture evolved to become Planet Comic-Con, EW began going to Comic-Con in San Diego every summer, led by Lisa Simpson, Sean Smith, and an assortment of outstanding editors. Moderating panels became a thing at Geek Mardi Gras; doing the Firefly reunion and the Veronica Mars comeback were highlights. Comic-Con has become an overwhelming zoo. A very sweaty overwhelming zoo. I do not like sweating. But I’ll probably miss it.\n\nNothing beat going to Hogwarts. Our coverage of Harry Potter got off to an interesting start. Warner Bros. had a very specific media strategy for launching that brand — and it didn’t include Entertainment Weekly. Silly Warner Bros. We responded by getting Glenn Close-in-Fatal Attraction on them. We would not be ignored. Mark teamed with Dan Fierman — one of the most tenacious journalists I have ever known — to write and report a cover story on the first Potter movie. We scooped everyone else and served our readers well. Fierman did the heavy-lifting; Mark edited the hell out of it and protected us from the corporate wrath that followed.\n\nOur rapport with Team Potter improved significantly, and I daresay we covered the franchise better than anyone. My annual check-ins with Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint were a sheer delight; it was a joy watching them grow up. Leavesden Studios was a wonderland of old-fashioned movie magic, the massive sets and intricate props designed by Stuart Craig and hand-made by hundreds of craftsmen filling every nook and cranny of that drafty, leaky old airplane plant. David Heyman created an environment where the kids could grow up well and artists could flourish, one of the great producing accomplishments in Hollywood history.\n\n2004 was a peak year and a turning point. I went to New Zealand to visit the set of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. I watched Tilda Swinton as The White Witch get in the mood by rocking out to Depeche Mode’s “Personal Jesus”; I saw Lucy weep over Aslan’s dead stuffed animal body. With reporting help from Allison Hope Weiner and ace editing by Mark and Jill, I wrote a cover story about the controversy surrounding The Passion of the Christ, a tough assignment that challenged me on many levels and was incredibly rewarding because of it.\n\nThat same spring, I wrote my favorite EW piece ever, a cover story edited by Rob Brunner about Prince. Being scolded by Prince for not praying before eating the meal we had together is one of the 50 greatest things that has ever happened to me. After the interview, which we did in his dressing room before a concert in Phoenix, Prince asked me to meet up with him following the show. I was dazed by the whole Prince experience, so I didn’t think to ask him, his bodyguards, or anyone what I should do to make that happen. I lingered in the arena after the crowd had left and made my way down to a curtain off the side of the stage and shyly explained to the very large and muscular man standing watch that I was supposed to be hanging out with Prince. I couldn’t have sounded any less convincing. The guy didn’t say anything. I turned around and walked away, a silent sad trombone playing in my head. I’ve made more profound mistakes here — I’ve been the cause of a few embarrassing corrections — but that fail was my biggest personal regret. I still can’t believe he’s gone. Also? I’ve never met a better smelling man in my life.\n\nIn the fall of 2004, ABC debuted a high-concept, intensely-serialized, mystery-driven drama from J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof about castaways on a mystical island inhabited by smokey monsters, feral polar bears, and assorted Others. Only three other shows have ever lit me up the way Lost did: Miami Vice, Twin Peaks, and The X-Files. By the time the show premiered, I was well known in the office for emailing staffers my elaborate theories about shared obsessions, most notably Alias. As Lost captured my imagination and ran away with it, I began besieging my colleagues with conjectures about The Island, The Monster, The Numbers, and What it All Meant. In season 2, Henry and Dan Fierman pitched me on the idea of posting these theories on line, using the handle “Doc Jensen.” So it was their fault. The column earned a following. Some people loved it. Some hated it but read it anyway. I’m grateful beyond words for all of those readers.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, I pitched the idea of J.J., Damon, and Carlton Cuse sitting down with one of their creative heroes and big-time Lost fan Stephen King for a conversation about how to tell mystery stories on TV. They all agreed. I didn’t need to be there; King served as moderator and did an ace job of it. But hell yes I was going to Maine to be a fly on the wall for that! Afterward, we all went to dinner and a movie, The Descent. After King left us, we all stood in the parking lot, in the rain, a bit dazed. Did we just go on a date with Stephen King? We did.\n\nThe Lost adventure meant so much to me, professionally and personally, in so many ways, but the story that means to the most to me is this. In January of 2007, I was in my office writing the first paragraph of a cover story about the third season when my phone rang. It was Amy. She was talking but she wasn’t making sense. It just sounded wrong. I called an ambulance for her. By the end of the evening, we knew she had a brain tumor. This was a crisis. This was a fire drill, but with, like, real fire. And that’s when I realized I didn’t just work with some of the best writers, reporters, and thinkers in journalism, but with a Scooby gang of world-savers. When I think about my time at EW, I think about a group of people who carried my family through an inferno and are now permanently knitted into the fabric of my being like mythology; they are superheroes, none more super than Dan Snierson. That Lost cover story — which he took on and finished, with editing by Dalton Ross and Kristen Baldwin — represents perhaps the smallest of his gestures in the grand scheme of things, but because there’s a physical expression of it, in the form of a magazine with our shared byline on the cover, it’s a symbol of his support and the support of everyone at EW at that time. It’s the first thing that pops into my head when I think about all the things I did here.\n\nI became even more obsessed with Lost as I took on the recap duties in the middle of season 3. Edited and built by an array of editors who were surely traumatized by the experience, those recaps got increasingly longer and goofier and denser and heavier as they became an escape from what was going on at home, for better and worse. They took my mind off my fear and uncertainty, while at the same time nudging me to confront my disorientation and despair. After all, it was a show about being lost. But the recaps are difficult for me to read now because their search for meaning was my search for meaning, their beyond-my-grasp ambition was my need for significance amid a season of life in which I felt very small, their messiness, my messiness. They show me how I use and abuse pop culture to numb and run away, they show me how I make work a self-serving idol. I question how well they served you all. They represented an attempt to “solve Lost,” thus encouraging the impression that Lost was a puzzle to be solved, which is not the best way to engage the show, or any show. It’s a fun way. I can defend it! But it’s not the best. If the recaps enriched your experience, I’m glad. If they exacerbated your confusion, I’m truly sorry. That wasn’t fair to you or Lost.\n\nMy favorite parts of the Lost experience were getting to know readers, getting to know so many of the extraordinary people who made the show, and getting to work with Dan on so many Lost-related projects during the last three years of the series, especially our gonzo “Totally Lost” video series, produced and edited by Jason Averett. My favorite Lost memory? Being on the set of the finale, for the scene in which the souls of the castaways gathered in the church in the sideways world and went away in a blaze of light. Amy loved the finale; it spoke to her deep faith and many hopes for her family. She died on June 19, 2014. We are in a pretty good place today, thanks in large part to my EW family. To the community of Lost fans who kept us in your thoughts and prayers and have honored Amy in various ways, thank you. Jo Garfein and Jared Wong of Cancer Gets Lost, you are beautiful people.\n\nIn my last four years at EW, I’ve had the honor of being the TV critic, writing for several editors, most recently, the very patient Amy Wilkinson. In that time, I also wrote features about Christopher Nolan movies for Sean and various TV shows for Meeta Agrawal, Bill Keith, and more, but nothing has been more growing and challenging than trying to engage TV with a more critical mind. It’s been a struggle for me — a guy who only ever wanted to work in print — to evolve into a digital-era journalist. So I appreciate the grace of all our website editors over the years, especially Christopher Rosen. I have been terrible at telling every photo editor, designer, and copy editor how much their work has meant to me, even as I made their work harder with late copy and changes. Forgive me. The late, great researcher extraordinaire Jenny Boeth, dearly missed here, made everything better and worth the page and your attention. So did Josh Rich and Jeff Labrecque, now a fantastic editor here. I worked on a couple different podcasts with Darren Franich, a great guy with a huge, geeky brain, dynamite way with words, and generous spirit. And a beard. Our conversations remind me of why I love pop culture, why I think it’s important to take it seriously but also to have fun with it, and why I wanted to work for Entertainment Weekly. Thank you, Henry Goldblatt, for every opportunity you’ve given me here, your leadership, and your massive heart. I will never love Shondaland shows the way you love Shondaland shows, but I do love you.\n\nIn my first year at EW, I interviewed David Lynch on three separate occasions for three different pieces, including an oral history of Twin Peaks that we did for the magazine’s 10th anniversary issue. I visited him at his home in the Hollywood Hills, and the walk up the winding path to his painting studio in his backyard is seared into my memory. That movement represents everything I ever wanted from this job: The chance to talk to great artists in their space about the stories that fill our culture and move us and shape us, that tell us who we are and help make us who we are. It was full-circle fitting to go out covering Twin Peaks: The Return and to engage a masterpiece with features (edited by Bill), reviews (Amy!), recaps (Kelly Connolly!), and very, very long podcasts recorded with Darren and produced by Cristina Everett. To borrow from Agent Cooper, The Return was a journey that led us to “a place both wonderful and strange,” which is exactly how I would sum up my time at EW, too. I leave here to chase some new dreams in different fields away from journalism — the movie theater/bookstore/coffee shop thing is on hold; still figuring our lattes — but I doubt I’ll ever have a better job than the one I had at EW. Thanks for letting me reflect on it. I hope to engage you in other places both wonderful and strange in the years to come.","author":"Jeff Jensen","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-15T14:30:20.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/xfilespotter.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1419px\u0026resize=1200%2C630","digest":"Z3RmFJHrdgdQRHUl20OaLw==\n"}

A crew member made her feel unsafe by showing up at her apartment after work and “staring daggers” at her on set. She reported this to a producer, who claimed “there are two sides to every story.”\n\n“For women in America who come forward with stories of harassment, abuse and sexual assault, there are not two sides to every story, however noble that principle might seem,” Tamblyn wrote. “Women do not get to have a side. They get to have an interrogation. Too often, they are questioned mercilessly about whether their side is legitimate. Especially if that side happens to accuse a man of stature, then that woman has to consider the scrutiny and repercussions she’ll be subjected to by sharing her side.”\n\nIn recent days, Tamblyn was called a liar by Woods, who started a recent situation on social media. The actor criticized Armie Hammer’s film Call Me By Your Name for depicting a relationship between a 24- and 17-year-old. Hammer dropped the hammer when referenced how Woods began dating a 20-year-old woman when he was 66.\n\n“In an instant, I was reminded of a memory from when I was 16,” Tamblyn wrote of this situation. “Mr. Woods attempted to pick me and a friend up when we were at Mel’s diner in Hollywood, seeing if we wanted to go to Las Vegas with him that very night. I informed him of my age, to which he said, ‘Even better.’ I told this story publicly as a way to back up the claim that Mr. Woods was, indeed, a hypocrite. Mr. Woods called my account a lie.”\n\nShe added, “Mr. Woods’ accusation that I was lying sent me back to that day in that producer’s office, and back to all the days I’ve spent in the offices of men; of feeling unsure, uneasy, questioned and disbelieved, no matter the conversation.”\n\nRead Tamblyn’s full op-ed in Sunday’s New York Times.\n\nAfter the initial back-and-forth unfolded on Twitter, Tamblyn posted a screenshot of a text conversation with the friend in question, who backed up her claim against Woods. “Since I know people love to question the intengrity and honesty of women when they come forward with stories like this, here you go,” she tweeted.\n\nWhen Woods denied the accusation, Tamblyn fired back in a column published by Teen Vogue. “It is with hope, Mr. Woods, that I ask you to go inward now and ask yourself the hard stuff,” she wrote. “Are you and your history with women and girls a part of the problem, Mr. Woods?”","author":"Nick Romano","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T21:37:20.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-679265030.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px\u0026resize=1200%2C630","digest":"uafqgzceU1PfYzKI1WpCtQ==\n"}

(too dark for The Dark Knight to weather), the studio brought on filmmaker Darren Aronofsky to make a new future for the Caped Crusader with Joaquin Phoenix as Batman. Of course, none of that actually happened, but it could have if the WB took to his movie concept.\n\nDuring the press tour for his new film mother!, Aronofsky revealed the Her and Inherent Vice actor was his pick to lead the Batman movie that never came to fruition.\n\n“I always wanted Joaquin Phoenix for Batman,” he told Yahoo Movies. “It’s funny, I think we were just sort of out of time with our idea. I understood that [with] comics, that there’s room for all different types of titles, but I think Hollywood at that time was still kind of in the Golden Age of comics, and they were still just doing the classic titles in classic ways.”\n\nAronofksy’s take was loosely based on Frank Miller’s Batman: Year One, and he even brought Miller on to co-write the script. As he explained to The Guardian in 2007, “It was a hard R-rated Batman. What I pitched them was Travis Bickle meets The French Connection — a real guy running around fighting crime. No super-powers, no villains, just corruption. For the Batmobile, I had him taking a bus engine and sticking it in a black Lincoln. Real low-tech geek stuff.”\n\n“It was the first time I worked on a Batman project with somebody whose vision of Batman was darker than mine,” Miller said in an interview last year. “My Batman was too nice for him,” he added. “I’d say, ‘Batman wouldn’t do that, he wouldn’t torture anybody.’”\n\nThe project never moved forward because the Warner Bros. executive at the time “wanted to do a Batman he could take his kids to.” A few years later, Christopher Nolan would come into the superhero genre with Christian Bale in Batman Begins, not exactly a classic kid-friendly take.","author":"Nick Romano","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T18:43:11.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/batman-joaquin-phoenix.jpg?crop=0px%2C11px%2C2700px%2C1418px\u0026resize=1200%2C630","digest":"xfhT7hb8AdgZSjYWF6BR5g==\n"}

So why aren't casual fans excited for the fight?","title":"Canelo, Golovkin still fighting to reach casual fans","url":"http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/20705131/canelo-alvarez-gennady-golovkin-fighting-reach-casual-fans","text":"Dan Rafael is predicting fireworks between Gennady Golovkin and Canelo Alvarez in the later rounds of their bout. (1:56)\n\nLAS VEGAS -- The barista at the Starbucks on the casino floor of the MGM Grand was just trying to make conversation as she likely does with most customers taking a coffee break from losing their savings on the craps tables lining the floor in front of her.\n\n\"What brings you to Vegas?\" she asked me.\n\n\"Canelo-GGG,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, what's that?\" she inquired.\n\n\"You know, the fight,\" I explained.\n\n\"Oh, right, the fight,\" she said. \"That should be fun.\"\n\n\"You don't know Canelo Alvarez or Gennady Golovkin?\" I asked her.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"But I'm not a boxing fan.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time I've covered a fight involving Alvarez or Golovkin where I've had a similar conversation with a friend or stranger who isn't a boxing fan.\n\nCanelo Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin square off Saturday in one of the biggest fights in boxing history. John Locher/AP Photo\n\nThe fact is that the two most popular active boxers and two of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world today aren't yet transcendent stars. In other words, if you're a boxing fan, their fight on Saturday at T-Mobile Arena is a dream match you've been waiting years to see. If you're not a boxing fan, there's a good chance you don't know who these guys are or why it's a big deal.\n\nThe chasm that exists between boxing fans and casual fans with these fighters and this fight is one of the biggest reasons the best boxing matchup in years likely will draw a third of the pay-per-view audience that Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor's fight did last month.\n\nIf Mayweather-McGregor pulled in a record 4.7 million pay-per-view buys, as some have projected, Canelo-Golovkin pulling a third of that number would be about 1.4 million. It would still represent the largest pay-per-view number either fighter has drawn, outside of the 2.2 million that Mayweather and Alvarez drew four years ago, and would be justifiably viewed as a success by all parties involved.\n\nIt will also drive home the fact that both fighters need to do a better job of marketing themselves outside of the ring in order to become the stars their promoters want them to be.\n\nThere's no doubt Alvarez, who recently turned 27, is a rising star. His fight against Mayweather in 2013 was the second-biggest pay-per-view fight at the time, falling just short of Mayweather's fight against Oscar De La Hoya in 2007, which did 2.4 million. His last fight against Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. drew 1.2 million and showed he could attract a big number when facing a big name, albeit not a great boxer.\n\nThe problem is most of his fights in between failed to move the needle. His fight last year with Liam Smith drew 300,000 and his fight before that against Amir Khan did 600,000. Then again, those are pay-per-view numbers Golovkin would love to have. His last fight against Daniel Jacobs in March did 170,000 and his fight against David Lemieux did just 150,000.\n\nThose aren't numbers that a superstar draws, but then again, that's a reality for boxers right now when you look at the rest of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world. The much-anticipated match between Andre Ward and Sergey Kovalev, two of the top five pound-for-pound fighters, last year did 165,000. Their rematch in June drew just 125,000.\n\nSo what do Alvarez and Golovkin have to do to break through to casual fans and seep into the consciousness of the barista at Starbucks working across the street from where the fight is taking place?\n\n\"I don't know, I don't have the answer,\" Alvarez told me through a translator. \"What I do is I concentrate on doing my thing and working hard. I'm giving the fight fans the fights they want to see. Fights like this, to attract the boxing fans, to attract Canelo fans and to attract people that love boxing. But outside of that, to attract the casual fans, I don't know what we have to do.\"\n\nThat's an understandable answer to have 72 hours before a fight, but it doesn't address Alvarez's ceiling as a star domestically. While he understands English and can speak a few phrases, such as telling Sylvester Stallone to \"Be bolder!\" in a Tecate beer commercial, he still conducts his English interviews through a translator.\n\nWhen I talked to De La Hoya, who signed Alvarez to a contract with Golden Boy Promotions in 2010, about Alvarez six years ago, which was three years after his first fight in the United States, he told me, \"He can speak English but he's just shy. Remember [Julio Cesar] Chavez when they would ask him something in English? He could speak it but wouldn't. [Alvarez] can speak it but he's just shy. He just has to get more confidence. Hopefully he'll master it soon enough.\"\n\nHe hasn't, which hasn't hurt his stock with his strong Latino fan base, but it's hard to grow that fan base and become a megastar when De La Hoya is still making the rounds on television and radio shows promoting Alvarez and his fights instead of Alvarez doing it himself. Golovkin, who is from Kazakhstan, has been working on his English since moving to the United States five years ago. It's still a work in progress and he still has a translator by his side in case he needs a question repeated in Russian, but for the most part he powers through interviews as best as he can in English.\n\n\"I know I need to learn English,\" Golovkin told me on Wednesday. \"I feel comfortable. Of course not 100 percent but you understand my emotion. If you want more, just bring a translator, but I can give you 10 percent, like my emotion. I feel perfect, my body is perfect, everything is good, I'm very excited. I think you understand.\" Golovkin's trainer, Abel Sanchez, has made it an unwritten rule that Golovkin and his other fighters can speak English only when they're in his gym. Not only because he wants them to communicate with him and understand what he's saying, but he believes it's important for them to be doing television and radio interviews instead of their trainer or promoter.\n\n\"I try every day to make sure I don't hear Russian in my gym,\" Sanchez said. \"I try to make sure that they speak the language. I ask them questions about cars or their families just so they can talk to me because I think it's important for them [to do the interviews], not me. It's unfortunate Canelo's not learning; he should be learning more. It's unfortunate Golovkin's not learning; he should be learning more, but it's their choice. That's the way they are. They're quiet.\"\n\nBeing \"quiet\" doesn't normally sell fighters or fights, but if Alvarez and Golovkin are able to put on a fight that lives up to the hype on Saturday and leads toward an even more hyped rematch next year, perhaps that will help them become the transcendent stars they have the potential to become outside of the ring. Until then they will continue to captivate fight fans while leaving casual fans wondering who they are.","author":"Arash MarkaziESPN Senior Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-14T21:11:23.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0913%2Fr257958_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"S6ws73MUBXyezK6JeVbe0A==\n"}

(0:39)\n\nLAS VEGAS -- On May 6, moments after Canelo Alvarez finished rolling over Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. in a shutout decision that wasn't competitive for a moment, Gennady Golovkin's ring walk music -- The White Stripes' \"Seven Nation Army\" -- hit, and the T-Mobile Arena crowd suddenly perked up and erupted in cheers.\n\nIn pure WWE style, Alvarez had called Golovkin to the ring to tell him he was next, and GGG made his way to the ring for a joint interview to close the HBO PPV telecast. At long last, the mega match had been made official nearly two years after it had become the next must-see fight in boxing, but put off by Oscar De La Hoya of Golden Boy Promotions, Alvarez's promoter, who didn't want to risk his cash cow just yet while allowing him to grow into a true middleweight.\n\nCanelo Alvarez vs. Gennady Golovkin Where: T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas\n\nWhen: Saturday\n\nTV: HBO PPV, 8 p.m. ET • Middleweights: Gennady Golovkin (37-0, 33 KOs) vs. Canelo Alvarez (49-1-1, 34 KOs), 12 rounds, for Golovkin's unified world title • Featherweights: Joseph Diaz (24-0, 13 KOs) vs. Rafael Rivera (25-0-2, 16 KOs), 12 rounds, world title eliminator • Junior featherweights: Diego De La Hoya (19-0, 9 KOs) vs. Randy Caballero (24-0, 14 KOs), 10 rounds • Lightweights: Ryan Martin (19-0, 11 KOs) vs. Francisco Rojo (20-2, 13 KOs), 10 rounds\n\nHowever long it took, Golovkin finally has the big fight he craved and dreamed of for years. Golovkin and Alvarez will meet to determine middleweight supremacy and quite possibly No. 1 on the pound-for-pound list on Saturday (HBO PPV, 8 p.m. ET) at T-Mobile Arena in one of the most anticipated fights in years.\n\n\"It is [the] biggest fight for boxing. Two warriors, two big boxers and I think great style,\" said Golovkin, who will be making his 19th title defense, one shy of Bernard Hopkins' division record. \"Canelo's style and my style [are] very close and very similar. [It's] very interesting. I feel good right now. I think he feels [the] best of his career right now. I think this is the biggest test for us. Who's stronger? Who is boxing's No. 1 pound-for-pound in the world?\"\n\nA fight of this magnitude has been a long time coming for Golovkin, who finally landed a huge fight at age 35 and after 11 years as a professional.\n\n\"We have been talking about this fight for years,\" Golovkin said. \"The last two years, I lose interest, because after every fight, Golden Boy said, 'No. OK, maybe next fight.'\"\n\nGolovkin was particularly stung when after Alvarez drilled Amir Khan in May 2016, De La Hoya said he would attempt to make the fight next and didn't. Alvarez even vacated a middleweight world title last year in order to put off a mandatory fight with Golovkin.\n\nJohn Locher/AP Photo\n\n\"I remember the situation after the Amir Khan fight, when I go into the ring,\" GGG said. \"Oscar De La Hoya said, 'This is a good day for us and I will call GGG's manager tomorrow.' I think it was hard on the fans, too. The fans are hungry for this fight. After the Julio Cesar Chavez fight, I believed it is possible for us, and in June I see Canelo's face and it is more serious. He is ready. This was not like Canelo not being ready. It was Golden Boy not being ready.\"\n\nAbel Sanchez, Golovkin's trainer, couldn't believe how long it took for GGG to get a truly big fight.\n\n\"I was surprised a silver medalist (for Kazakhstan in the 2004 Olympics) with 350 amateur fights and five losses, [who] beat the major players at that time in boxing, wasn't getting recognition,\" Sanchez said.\n\nFor years, Golovkin, as exciting to watch and as talented as anyone, nonetheless toiled. He was signed to Germany's Universum Box-Promotions, the now-defunct onetime powerhouse, but he was largely ignored by the company, which was more interested in putting its muscle behind an assortment of German titleholders and ticket sellers. Golovkin was neither German nor a ticket seller and relegated to undercards in nondescript fights.\n\nEven when GGG ascended to the mandatory position for then-middleweight titleholder Felix Sturm, a major star for Universum, he could not get the fight. Universum denied him over and over, prompting him to bolt the promotional company, which sued him and forced Golovkin to hit the road for fights.\n\nSanchez remembers those days well.\n\n\"We had to go to Panama to fight for nothing; we went to Germany and fought for nothing; went to Ukraine - fought for nothing,\" Sanchez said. \"But it was a way of building his name up, building his reputation up, building everything up. We were willing to do the sacrifice in order to get him to this point now.\"\n\nIt was a long road but Golovkin (37-0, 33 KOs), who now lives in Santa Monica, California, with his wife, son and an infant daughter who was born on Friday.\n\nSanchez said there were times where Golovkin was frustrated by not being able to get a major pay-per-view dance partner even after he had unified belts and became an HBO staple.\n\nEditor's Picks Gennady Golovkin on Canelo Alvarez fight: \"I have been ready for years.\" Gennady Golovkin has waited years for a career-defining superfight. On Sept. 16 against Canelo Alvarez, he finally gets one.\n\nCanelo-GGG is the fight we've been waiting for\n\nBreaking down the Alvarez-Golovkin match Ready for the real megafight of the century? Here comes Canelo Alvarez vs. Gennady Golovkin. Dotun Akintoye breaks down the tape. 2 Related\n\n\"Many times (we talked about it). I'd say that you got to keep winning. Just keep winning, keep doing what you're doing, keep knocking people out,\" Sanchez said. \"Eventually those guys are going to have to come to you.\"\n\nIn 2012 Golovkin hooked up with promoter Tom Loeffler, who went to work trying to get Golovkin a televised fight in the United States.\n\n\"The blueprint was, when we met with HBO, we said Gennady will fight anyone,\" Loeffler said. \"They had a list of 20 fighters, 20 names of different fighters, anywhere from 154 (pounds) to 168, and Abel and Gennady didn't turn down any one of those. That blew HBO away. They've never been used to someone willing to fight everyone. They realized, if there wasn't a fight that was able to be made, it wasn't on the GGG side. I was very transparent with all the negotiations, everyone that we reached out to.\"\n\nFive years ago this month, Golovkin made his American and HBO debut and absolutely destroyed solid contender Grzegorz Proksa in five one-sided rounds. He had arrived and became a staple on HBO, but still couldn't get a top opponent to get into the ring with him even though he was developing a big fan base, selling out Madison Square Garden in New York and The Forum and StubHub Center in Southern California.\n\nIt was nothing new for top fighters to find reasons not fight Golovkin, he of the recently finished streak of 23 knockouts in a row.\n\nWhile many opponents dodged Gennady Golovkin, Kell Brook stepped up in 2016. GGG won the fight via fifth-round TKO Richard Heathcote/Getty Images\n\nSturm blatantly ducked him. Sergio Martinez was shielded from him and his handlers didn't even try to hide it with promoter Lou DiBella saying he would never match his meal ticket \"with that beast.\" Miguel Cotto was not interested. Titleholder Billy Joe Saunders turned down the fight and career money. Contender Chris Eubank Jr. did the same. It got so bad that Golovkin went to London last September to defend against Kell Brook, a welterweight titlist at the time, who moved up two weight classes because had his own issues getting a marquee opponent.\n\nInstead Golovkin, who will be fighting in Las Vegas for the first time, feasted on solid contenders but not the best of the division, though he was able to unify belts when David Lemieux dared to be great by putting his title on the line in late 2015.\n\nThen it appeared that Alvarez (49-1-1, 34 KOs), 27, of Mexico, was going to avoid him also as De La Hoya made Golovkin wait nearly two years for the fight.\n\n\"This is the fight that we've been working for,\" Loeffler said. \"Every fight in Gennady's career, really since he made his HBO debut September 2012 -- this fight is almost five years to the day -- and every fight since then, this is really the fight that we've been working for. It would have been great if he'd had this type of fight earlier in his career, but the other name opponents, or the champions even, weren't willing to get in the ring with him.\n\n\"All the knockouts, all the training, all the hard work, all the sacrifice that Gennady's made has been built toward this exact fight in his career.\"\n\nFor Golovkin, this fight is exactly where he wants to be. It is what he has yearned for years, to prove himself against another one of the best fighters in the world. There is a sense of relief in him that he finally has it.\n\n\"All my career I've been denied the fights I've wanted,\" Golovkin said. \"That ends Saturday night.\"","author":"Dan RafaelESPN Senior Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-14T18:06:14.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0913%2Fr257958_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"hYJk8HagfuK7DCIrunxiUw==\n"}

The usually unflappable Michigan quarterback seemed to be flapping late in the third quarter Saturday while an equally flummoxed home crowd booed the Wolverines offense for the second straight week.\n\nNo. 7 Michigan escaped a scare from Air Force 29-13 to stay unbeaten three games into the regular season. The final score belies the fact that the Falcons stayed within striking distance late into the fourth quarter and left the crowd in Ann Arbor concerned for an offense that has lacked creativity, explosive plays and the ability to finish drives. Michigan entered the game dead last among Power 5 schools in the percentage of red-zone trips that ended in touchdowns and was shut out on its four attempts inside the 20 Saturday.\n\nTy Isaac and the Michigan offense were able to overcome Air Force with a subpar performance, but that won't play when the Wolverines face Big Ten opponents. Rick Osentoski/USA TODAY Sports\n\nSpeight's exasperation showed after a wave of Air Force tacklers swallowed up a handoff to Ty Isaac in the Michigan backfield on a third-down play 8 yards from the end zone. That sent rookie kicker Quinn Nordin trotting from the sideline for the fourth of his record-tying five field goals on the afternoon. Nordin's 10 field goals through three games will probably be the most in college football when the weekend comes to a close. That is not the type of first-place spot that Michigan and an offense that pushed the creative envelope a year ago were hoping to hold as they get set for Big Ten play.\n\n\"Obviously, the frustration built up a little bit,\" Speight said. \"But it was one of things where it was like, 'Ah, they fooled us.'\"\n\nSpeight and head coach Jim Harbaugh said Air Force's defense disguised its blitzes well throughout the game, especially in the red zone, to get the better of them on several occasions. Harbaugh said that while of course his team would like to be finishing those drives with touchdowns, he's confident that those will come as they continue to progress.\n\nIn the meantime, youth has helped the Wolverines plow ahead. Nordin and the rest of his underclassmen brethren were viewed as a liability this summer, as outsiders wondered how Harbaugh's fresh-faced recruits would handle the pressure of stepping into starring roles. Right now they are carrying the offense through its sluggish start.\n\nSophomore linebacker Devin Bush led the defense with 11 tackles and on two occasions smothered a rare pass attempt before Air Force's Arion Worthman had a chance to look downfield. Freshman Donovan Peoples-Jones scored one of the team's two touchdowns with his effortless 79-yard weaving run on a punt return in the third quarter. He finished the game with 156 all-purpose yards. Then there was Nordin, who comfortably made all five of his kicks, including a 49-yard attempt to give Michigan a 9-6 lead in the closing seconds of the first half.\n\nSpeight's performance came under fire last week and will likely draw a fresh batch of criticism. He completed 14 of his 23 attempts for 169 yards through the air, at times overlooking open targets or missing them when he did spot them.\n\nResponsibility for the inconsistency in getting the ball to the Wolverines' young playmakers, though, should fall as much on the coaching staff. Michigan struggled to find any rhythm in its calls. Harbaugh, offensive coordinator Tim Drevno and passing game coordinator Pep Hamilton share those duties. While former coordinator Jedd Fisch was breaking out the 11-man \"snake\" I-formation at his new gig at UCLA, the Wolverines lacked the type of ingenuity that inspired those types of interesting looks and the Big Ten's most productive offense (40.3 points per game) last fall.\n\nMichigan doesn't need to put up 40 points on most weekends to keep its title hopes alive. The defense remains fierce and entertaining -- holding the Falcons to 232 yards and only one touchdown on a busted coverage. That side of the ball has still made as many trips to the end zone as it has allowed this season.\n\nThe Wolverines will need to be more opportunistic, though. Trading field goals for would-be touchdowns is enough to beat smaller teams from smaller conferences. It won't be enough to make it through the upcoming Big Ten slate unscathed.\n\n\"We'll keep forging ahead, keep making improvements. I like where our team is right now,\" Harbaugh said. \"... Our team is moving the ball. That's a fact. I think the red-zone touchdowns will come.\"\n\nHarbaugh added: \"It's good to be Wilton Speight right now,\" pointing out that the junior was the quarterback of the No. 7 team in the country with an unbeaten record. Speight's frustrations won't boil away, though, until those touchdowns start to come.","author":"Dan MurphyESPN Staff Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T19:13:51.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0916%2Fr259367_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"ZhsTLc2Mc4qJNXTFtdZhWw==\n"}

Rudolph also set a school record for passing yards in a half with 423.\n\nFor the game, Rudolph, who was sixth on the ESPN Heisman Watch this week, completed 23 of 32 passes for 497 yards and five touchdowns before taking a seat early in the third quarter. Despite playing a little over a half, Rudolph was 44 passing yards away from breaking the school record for passing yards in a game he set against Pitt.\n\nIn addition to Rudolph's prolific afternoon, the Cowboys became the first offense since Texas Tech in 2005 to have four different receivers finish with 100 or more yards receiving in a single game, as Jalen McCleskey (162 yards), James Washington (124), Ateman (109) and Dillon Stoner (100) all hit the 100-yard threshold. The Pokes were even without key wideout Tyron Johnson, who didn’t make the trip to Pitt because of a team violation.\n\nWith the Oklahoma schools off to such impressive starts, Bedlam on November 4 in Stillwater is already shaping up to be one of the biggest games of the year in college football.\n\nOklahoma State, however, will face its biggest test to date next week against TCU. The Horned Frogs held Arkansas to just 267 yards in a convincing 28-7 victory in Fayetteville last weekend. Coming into Saturday, TCU ranked fourth nationally in total defense.\n\nThe Horned Frogs will have their hands full. After three weeks, the Cowboys are averaging 54 points a game.","author":"Jake TrotterESPN Staff Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T19:24:25.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0916%2Fr259365_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"3mtVrocZdPVC3CmUIaK85A==\n"}

Here are the most- and least-favorable matchups at QB, RB, WR and TE for Week 2 in the NFL. 1 Related\n\nYou went into the season excited about the value you got and the big upside of Allen Robinson. You were loving life for the first quarter of Danny Woodhead's Ravens career.\n\nFor the first time ever, you finally got the No. 1 pick in your league and for once, you didn't have to sweat over it. You took David Johnson without a second thought and slept well that night.\n\nAnd now, before we have even started Week 2, you don't know what the hell happened. It's all crumbling before your eyes. Sifting through the waivers like a vagrant in the desert, hoping for crumbs, trying to talk yourself into it. \"Allen Hurns was good once, right? He could do it again, maybe?\"\n\nYou're in bad shape. I feel for you, my brothers and sisters. But I assure you. There's someone out there in fantasy football land who has it worse than you.\n\nAnd his name is Patrick.\n\nJeff Lewis lives in Saratoga Springs, New York. His 12-team league is entering its 15th season. The participants have known each other for 30 years and the league is very close. Among them is Patrick, an active owner who works the wire, actively makes trades and is a two-time league champion.\n\nWatch The Fantasy Show every weekday The Fantasy Show with Matthew Berry airs at 5 p.m. ET on ESPN2 every weekday. We will, however, be on ESPN on Mondays during the season. There are also late night re-airs (check your listings and set those DVRs) and replays are always available on WatchESPN by clicking on the NFL tab.\n\nBut that success is long gone. I've played this game for more than 30 years and written about it professionally for 18, and I thought I had heard and seen it all. But I've never seen this.\n\nIn 2015, Patrick went 3-10. And then, in 2016, Patrick went 0-13. He is off to an 0-1 start this year.\n\nOver the course of three seasons, Patrick is riding a 24-game losing streak. Twenty-four games. In a row.\n\nJeff tells me there have been close calls, amazing bad beats and that Patrick is absolutely trying, setting his lineup every week and making reasonable moves. But week in, week out ... \"L.\" Poor Jeff writes a recap every week for the league, writing clever footnotes and trash-talking with each team. He has run out of things to say about Patrick.\n\nBut I don't want you to give up, Patrick. I want you to hang in there. You and everyone else who lost David Johnson this week. I want you to listen closely.\n\n(With apologies to Al Pacino, Oliver Stone, screenwriter John Logan and, frankly, the entire cast and crew of \"Any Given Sunday.\")\n\nI don't know what to say, really. Three days to the biggest battle of our fake football lives all comes down to Sunday. Either we heal as a collection of statistics or we are going to crumble.\n\nInch by inch.\n\nDecimal point by decimal point, 'til we're finished.\n\nWe are in hell right now, gentlemen and women.\n\nBelieve me, we can stay here and get the crap kicked out of us, whine about our fantasy studs going down ... or we can fight our way back into the light.\n\nWe can climb out of hell.\n\nOne inch at a time.\n\nNow I can't do it for you. I'm too old, I'm behind a computer screen. I look around and I see these avatars and team names and I think ...\n\nI mean ...\n\nI made every wrong choice a middle-age man could make.\n\nI had Woodhead and Robinson in a 16-team league. I had Matthew Stafford on the hate list Week 1, believe it or not. I chased off anyone who has ever wanted to be on TV with me. ... I had to talk to a robot. And lately, I can't even stand the tweets I read.\n\nIs your fantasy team hurting with Danny Woodhead on the sideline? Matthew Berry has the pep talk you need. Ian Johnson/Icon Sportswire\n\nYou know when you get old in life, things get taken from you.\n\nThat's, that's part of life.\n\nBut you only learn that when you start losing stuff.\n\nYou find out that life is just a game of inches.\n\nSo is fantasy football.\n\nBecause in either game -- life or fantasy -- the margin for error is so small.\n\nI mean, one half-step too late to the waiver wire, one week too early to drop someone, and you don't quite make it.\n\nOne half-second too slow or too fast, and you don't quite get it.\n\nThe inches we need are everywhere around us.\n\nThey are in every break of the game, every minute, every second.\n\nOn this team, we fight for that inch. On this team, we tear ourselves -- and everyone around us -- to pieces for that inch. We CLAW with our fingernails for that inch.\n\n'Cause we know when we add up all those inches, that's going to make the freaking difference between WINNING and LOSING. Between LIVING and DYING.\n\nI'll tell you this: In any fight, it is the man or woman who is willing to die who is going to win that inch. The one who checks their phone at dinner. Who wakes up at 4 a.m. to make a free-agent claim so they don't lose their waiver priority. Who works the trade talks until the wee hours, not caring about their mobile messaging limits. Who puts the ESPN Fantasy App on their list of dependents.\n\nAnd I know if I am going to have any life anymore, it is because I am still willing to fight, and die for that inch because that is what living is. The 6 inches in front of your face, the screen that is omnipresent in your life.\n\nNow, I can't make you do it. You gotta look at the guys on your team. The future studs waiting to be picked up, or traded for. Look into their eyes. Now I think you are going to see guys who will go that inch with you. Look in the mirror. You are going to see someone who will sacrifice themselves for this team because they know, when it comes down to it, there is no other choice. What are you gonna do? Play fantasy hockey?\n\nThat's a team, gentlemen, and either we heal now, as a team, or we will die as individuals. That's fantasy football, guys. That's all it is. Now, whattaya gonna do?\n\nQuarterbacks I love in Week 2\n\nBen Roethlisberger is great at home. He plays at home in Week 2. You know what to do. Getty Images\n\nBen Roethlisberger, Steelers: Big Ben was bad in Week 1 and is playing Minnesota, which just shut down Drew Brees. I understand the pessimism on Ben this week. I don't care. He's at home, where since 2014 he has been the best quarterback in fantasy, averaging 24 points per game. Minnesota blitzed at a top-10 rate last season and created pressure at the third-highest frequency. However, since 2014, Ben is the third-most accurate passer against pressure. I'm #TeamBen this week.\n\nJameis Winston, Buccaneers: In what I am sure will be an emotional home opener for Tampa Bay, Winston makes his 2017 debut after finishing first in the NFL in air yards per attempt last season ... and now adds DeSean Jackson to his offense. Last year, the Bears had the second-worst touchdown-to-interception rate on deep passes (and with Austin Hooper scoring a wide-open touchdown way downfield in Week 1, it doesn't look like they've solved this), and I expect the Bears' defense to be more vulnerable on the road. Winston is a top-10 play for me this week.\n\nOthers receiving votes: Philip Rivers has now thrown multiple touchdown passes in 10 straight games, the longest streak by someone not named Peyton Manning since 2011. Back with a healthy Keenan Allen, I believe Rivers makes it 11 in the Chargers' home opener against a Dolphins team that last year gave up the fourth-most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks and was tied for sixth in most passing touchdowns allowed. ... I know, I know, he was brutal last week, but maybe the only thing worse than Carson Palmer was the Colts' defense. With no David Johnson, expect Palmer to air it out and have success against a team that coughed up 306 yards to Jared Goff last week. ... Since Pat Shurmur took over in Week 9 of last year, Sam Bradford has been a top-10 fantasy quarterback. It is always tough to play at Pittsburgh, but I believe he is more legit than not and have him as a top-15 play this week.\n\nQuarterbacks I hate in Week 2\n\nDak Prescott, Cowboys: I'm not picking on him, I swear. But on the road against a Denver defense that allowed the fewest passing yards last year makes him an easy choice to hate. Since the start of last season, only two quarterbacks have had multiple passing touchdowns against the Broncos: Rivers and Brees. I don't believe Prescott changes that this week in a game that should feature a ton of Ezekiel Elliott. Dak is outside my top 10.\n\nMatthew Berry's RotoPass Need help with customized ranks for your scoring system, lineup setting tools, season-long projections and in-season trades? You need the Ultimate Fantasy Football resource. Get ESPN Insider and five other leading fantasy football sites for one low price. You're welcome. -- Matthew Berry\n\nMatthew Stafford, Lions: Easily my worst call last week, when he was on the hate list in Week 1 and then, you know, threw four touchdowns. So, you've been warned. I was looking good for about 2½ quarters before Arizona collapsed and Stafford (along with Kenny Golladay) went nuts. Apologies for the terrible call last week.\n\nAnd yet, here I am, back again. Stafford is a different QB away from a dome, as he has seen his fantasy production dip by 24.5 percent when comparing his past 16 outdoor games to his past 16 indoors games. Against an embarrassed Giants team in a national TV game? I don't see him having another big game. There's a reason the Giants allowed the second-fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks last year, and with an offense that should be improved (I'm expecting Odell Beckham Jr. back), the Lions won't be able to control the clock the way Dallas did in Week 1.\n\nCarson Wentz, Eagles: It's one thing to do it to my Redskins, it's another to do it to the Chiefs in Kansas City, where the home team gave up the fewest fantasy points to opposing passers last season. Andy Reid and staff have had extra time to prepare for his former team and while I am generally a Wentz believer (and losing Eric Berry doesn't help Kansas City), I don't see Wentz being able to do what Tom Brady wasn't able to do last week and throw for over 270 yards. Wentz is outside my top 15 this week.\n\nRunning backs I love in Week 2\n\nTy Montgomery, Packers: Since the start of last season, the Falcons have allowed the most receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns to opposing running backs ... and also made Tarik Cohen a thing. Hopefully the \"Can he be a feature back?\" doubters are a little more quiet after Montgomery played 74 of 82 snaps last week and got 19 of 21 Green Bay running back carries. Expect good numbers for Montgomery in a high-scoring game against a poor-tacking Falcons team (allowed the second-most yards per carry after first contact last year).\n\nMarshawn Lynch will go Beast Mode against the Jets in Week 2. Getty Images\n\nMarshawn Lynch, Raiders: So weird. Who would have thought missing Sheldon Richardson would hurt his team's run defense? Sigh. As bad as I feel for Jets fans, I feel equally as happy for those who drafted Lynch. Beast Mode should eat against a New York squad that got gashed for a league-high 190 rushing yards in Week 1, including eight rushes of 10-plus yards, three more than any other team. In that game, the Bills averaged 8.36 yards per carry on 11 rushes to the left side (defense's right) against the Jets. Last season, with Richardson, the Jets allowed the second-fewest yards per carry in the league.\n\nJacquizz Rodgers, Buccaneers: He was a volume monster when he was the focal point last season (23.4 touches per game in his past five games without Doug Martin) and considering that the Bucs ranked seventh in time of possession while the Bears ranked 31st last season, Quizz should be among the touch leaders this weekend. That'll work when you consider that the Bears didn't contact runners until they were 2.71 yards downfield (10th-highest rate) and you'll win some bar bets with this stat: In 2016, Rodgers averaged more yards per carry after first contact than Ezekiel Elliott, DeMarco Murray and Melvin Gordon. It may not last, but while Martin is out, I'm in on the Quizz show.\n\nOthers receiving votes: James White played more snaps than any other running back for New England last week, and while it's true the Patriots were trailing, this is a team that throws a lot and he is their pass-catching back. I also like the fact he got a career-high 10 carries, a sign that he is expanding his game. Expect White to have a good game in a high-scoring affair with a Saints team that was tied for the third-most receiving touchdowns allowed to opposing running backs. ... It will be a running back by committee, but my expectation is Kerwynn Williams is the head of that Cardinals committee this week and against the Colts, that's enough to earn him flex consideration. ... Count me among the Tarik Cohen believers. While we very well may have seen the best game of his season, Buccaneers opponents completed passes to running backs at the sixth-highest rate in the league. In a game where I expect the Bucs to do well, the Bears will likely trail and there should be plenty of throwing (and throwing to Cohen), making him a solid PPR flex this week.\n\nRunning backs I hate in Week 2\n\nIsaiah Crowell, Browns: Buy low on him after this week, as I still believe in him long term, but this should be a second straight week of frustration for Crowell. The Ravens shut down the Bengals' running game last week, a trend that continued from last year when they were top eight in the NFL in fewest yards per rush to opposing running backs and fantasy points to opposing running backs. In three career road games against Baltimore, Crowell has just 26 carries for 78 yards (3.0 YPC) and no TDs.\n\nFrank Gore, Colts: A week after getting vultured by Marlon Mack, things get tougher for Gore in a home game against an Arizona squad that has allowed the fewest rushing yards per carry to opposing RBs since the beginning of last season (3.2). He hasn't run for a touchdown in eight straight games and while it's certainly possible he catches a lot of dump-offs (including potentially a score) from whomever the Colts roll out there at quarterback, it's also very likely this game is a mess and Indy struggles to move the ball and/or keep Arizona from piling it up. No thanks.\n\nAmeer Abdullah, Lions: Finally healthy. Finally getting a full workload (18 touches last week). Finally getting red zone work! Abdullah burst out of the gate with 41 total yards and zero yards on his four red zone carries! Wait, what? Oh yeah. In a game the Lions won and scored a lot, Abdullah was ... not great. Again. Better days are ahead for Abdullah (at least he's still healthy!) but I don't love his chances on Monday night against a Giants front seven that allowed the fifth-fewest RB points in 2016. Abdullah is not a consideration for me this week.\n\nWide receivers I love in Week 2\n\nBrandin Cooks, Patriots: OK, so the revenge game narrative didn't work last week for Adrian Peterson, but you don't need the narrative to see that Cooks will go off this week. After an embarrassing home loss, Bill Belichick has had extra time to figure out how to exploit a Saints team that is on a short week and allowed opponents to complete 50 percent of their deep passes last season, the second-highest rate in the league. Oh, and remember what Minnesota did to them last week? Gimme all the Brandin Cooks.\n\nGolden Tate, Lions: Returning to the slot worked out well for Tate last week and after leading the Lions with 10 receptions for 107 yards (on 12 targets), Tate should once again be in for a big workload. Since the start of last season, the Giants are bottom five in receptions and receiving yards allowed to players lined up in the slot. (Lining up in the slot will almost certainly keep Tate away from Janoris Jenkins, who helped hold Dez Bryant to two catches on nine targets in Week 1. Jenkins lined up in the slot five percent of the time last season.)\n\nWill Tyreek Hill say goodbye to defenders again in Week 2? Probably. EPA\n\nTyreek Hill, Chiefs: The Eagles have allowed the most receptions of 25-plus yards and have allowed the sixth-most yards after the catch to opposing WRs since the start of last season. Oh yeah, and they'll be playing the next 4-6 weeks without starting corner Ronald Darby. Enter Tyreek Hill, who led the Chiefs in Week 1 targets and set an NFL record by scoring a 60-plus-yard TD for his fifth consecutive game. You can exploit the Eagles deep, and the Redskins would have last week if not for dropped passes and missed plays ... but don't get me started. I have Hill as a top-15 play this week.\n\nAdam Thielen, Vikings: Last season, Pittsburgh allowed the fourth-most slot receptions in the NFL at nearly eight per game (7.8). Thielen had seven of the nine Viking slot receptions on Monday night (and 47 more yards from the slot than any other player in the NFL last week). Sam Bradford ranks behind only Matt Ryan in slot completion percentage (73.2 percent) since the beginning of last year, so yeah, Thielen made the love list last week and he's back on again this week.\n\nMatthew Berry's Fantasy Life App The FREE Fantasy Life app helps you dominate your fantasy league with on demand fantasy football advice, immediate feedback from polls, live chats to talk strategy, and banter about fantasy sports plus hilarious memes and gifs. FL is a smart, engaged community by fantasy players for fantasy players. Download and follow me at username @matthewberry!\n\nOthers receiving votes: I know last week was tough, but I am back in on both Chris Hogan and Ted Ginn Jr. in what should be a shootout between two teams that have struggled in defending the deep ball. ... Corey Coleman burned the Ravens last year for 104 yards and a pair of scores and is clearly the apple of DeShone Kizer's eye (team leader in targets, receptions and yards last week, plus their preseason time together was productive). In a game where Cleveland will have to throw to move the chains, I like Coleman as a WR3/4 with upside. ... John Brown was targeted nine times last week (nearly double his 2016 average) and if that usage is here to stay, Brown is poised for a big game against a Colts defense that allowed seven deep completions from Jared Goff last week. ... My guy Cooper Kupp had a strong debut (4-76-1) and should find room to operate against a Redskins secondary that has allowed opponents to complete 70.5 percent of passes to the slot since the beginning of last season (third-highest rate).\n\nWide receivers I hate in Week 2\n\nT.Y. Hilton, Colts: As long as Andrew Luck is out .... now and forever on the hate list. Especially when Hilton is gonna have to deal with Patrick Peterson. He's at home on the turf, so there's always a chance for a broken tackle or bad angle by a defender that leads to a score, but it's unlikely. I want no part of the Colts offense until Luck shows back up.\n\nDez Bryant, Cowboys: Just because it's obvious doesn't mean it's not true. The Broncos allowed a league-low 13 touchdown passes last season and if Bryant doesn't score, he's not going to help you. Since the beginning of last season, Bryant is averaging just 7.1 PPR points in games in which he does not score -- that would have been WR54 last week. Look, he's Dez and he's a big, physical receiver, so he always has a chance to score. But against a defense that allowed the fewest receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns last season, his odds of scoring are down. He's just a flex play for me.\n\nDeVante Parker, Dolphins: I'm in on Parker this season, but traveling to the West Coast for a battle with underrated corners Casey Hayward and Jason Verrett makes me believe he starts slow. It's one thing to be OK in preseason, it's another to do in the regular season. In the battle of the Chargers' defense versus Jay Cutler in his first game of the season, on the road, gimme the Bolts. My expectation is Miami tries to go run heavy here, putting Parker outside my top 30.\n\nTight ends I love in Week 2\n\nCharles Clay, Bills: Over the past five regular-season weeks, dating back (ding!) to last season, Clay is the third-best tight end in fantasy. Available in more than 80 percent of ESPN.com leagues, the 255-pound tight end is the only returning pass-catcher who had at least 150 receiving yards for the Bills last season, so it shouldn't be a surprise that Tyrod Taylor looked to him often -- his nine targets in Week 1 led the team. The Panthers allowed the second-most tight end touchdowns last season, so expect another top-10 performance from Clay.\n\nDelanie Walker should be Marcus Mariota's safety blanket this season. Jim Brown-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDelanie Walker, Titans: In case you weren't paying attention last week, the Jaguars have some pretty good corners. A.J. Bouye and Jalen Ramsey are no joke, so with the perimeter shut down and Eric Decker looking like he still needs to get up to game speed, I expect Walker to once again have a heavy target share and be Marcus Mariota's first option when the Jags bring pressure.\n\nOthers receiving votes: The Dolphins gave up 10 touchdowns to tight ends last year (third most) and I'm of the belief that last week was a fluke for Hunter Henry, not the new norm. I'm back in as a TE2 with upside. ... Speaking of that game, given how strong the corner play is for San Diego, er, Los Angeles and knowing Jay Cutler's penchant for tight ends, I like Julius Thomas on Sunday. ... Green Bay-Atlanta should be a shootout, meaning Martellus Bennett and Austin Hooper are in play. ... After allowing two touchdowns to Pittsburgh's Jesse James in Week 1, the Browns have now allowed 15 TDs to opposing TEs in their past 17 games, three more than any other team in that span. The Browns also have allowed the most red zone receptions to opposing TEs since the start of last season. So remember the name Nick Boyle. They like him a lot in Baltimore and he makes for a very nice (and cheap) TE option this week in DFS.\n\nTight ends I hate in Week 2\n\nJack Doyle, Colts: Sensing a theme, are we? The Cardinals allowed 101 TE points last season, the fewest in a single season over the past decade. Whoever the quarterback is for Indy should struggle mightily and in a tough matchup, Doyle is merely a touchdown-dependent, low-end TE2 this week.\n\nJared Cook, Raiders: Cook has found the end zone only once in his past 30 regular-season games. With an increase in targets to Amari Cooper in the red zone, you can't even hang your hat on that. Anytime you are on an NFL field you have a chance to score, but Cook's chances are much lower than most others'.\n\nDefenses to stream in Week 2\n\nFor updated order of preference, check out my rankings.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (vs. Dolphins, 78 percent available); Oakland Raiders (vs. Jets, 80 percent available); Baltimore Ravens (vs. Browns, 60 percent available); Tampa Bay Buccaneers (vs. Bears, 95 percent available)\n\nDefenses to avoid in Week 2\n\nNew England Patriots, Philadelphia Eagles, Minnesota Vikings\n\nMatthew Berry, The Talented Mr. Roto, wasn't making up the part about talking to a robot on TV.

(0:52)\n\nSo much for the idea of handcuffing your fantasy starters with their real-life backups.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars now have two No. 1 receivers (or none, depending on your perspective) in the wake of Allen Robinson's season-ending knee injury.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens will use two running backs -- and maybe a slot receiver -- to replace the production of Danny Woodhead.\n\nAnd the Arizona Cardinals might use five running backs to try to replace David Johnson, though that probably won't be enough.\n\nHere's the latest on these and other situations from ESPN's NFL Nation:\n\nDon't count out CJ2K: Kerwynn Williams was named the Cardinals' starter in the wake of Johnson's wrist injury. But the Cardinals also re-signed veteran Chris Johnson, who has much more experience being a workhorse back.\n\nWilliams is probably the one worth speculating on for now, in case he takes the opportunity and runs with it. But ESPN Cardinals reporter Josh Weinfuss said he wouldn't be surprised to see Chris Johnson pick up more of the workload late in Sunday's game at Indianapolis or in the next few weeks. Williams is smaller, at 5-foot-8 and 198 pounds, as compared to 5-foot-11 and 203 pounds for Johnson -- and he has never carried the ball more than 53 times in a season.\n\nThird-down back Andre Ellington also is in the mix. So the best advice is probably to stay away from Arizona's backfield entirely.\n\nWith the Cardinals aiming to use a number of backs to pave over the loss of David Johnson, veteran Chris Johnson, pictured above, could see carries later in games. AP Photo/Rick Scuteri\n\nLee the Jaguars WR to own: Jaguars wide receiver Marqise Lee said he knows the pressure is on him and fellow fourth-year pro Allen Hurns to step up in the wake of Robinson's injury, but he insisted, \"This is what we prepare for.\"\n\nESPN Jaguars reporter Mike DiRocco doesn't expect huge numbers from either, particularly because Jacksonville would like to lean on the running game. But DiRocco said Lee would be the one he would add to his fantasy team first because of his big-play ability.\n\n\"Matching what he did last season [63 catches for 851 yards] would be a good year, but I do think he improves on the three TDs from last year -- maybe in the six to seven range,\" DiRocco said.\n\nBoost for Allen, Campanaro: ESPN Ravens reporter Jamison Hensley told ESPN fantasy analyst Mike Clay in this week's Insider column that he thinks running back Buck Allen might get more touches than Terrance West, even though West is officially the starter. West should be the top goal-line option, but Allen is the more dependable pass-catcher, which was Woodhead's primary role.\n\nHensley also wrote about another under-the-radar option for an increased role: slot receiver Michael Campanaro.\n\nBelieve the breakouts?\n\n• Yes, ESPN Chicago Bears reporter Jeff Dickerson said, rookie runner/receiver Tarik Cohen deserves a spot in your fantasy lineup. Even though the 5-foot-6, 181-pounder flew in under the radar, the Bears have been fired up all summer about his versatility.\n\n\"Well, the secret's out,\" offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains said after the Bears used Cohen as a running back, inside receiver, outside receiver, downfield threat, punt returner and even as a quarterback in the Wildcat formation in Week 1.\n\nDickerson said he doesn't think Cohen will be a threat to RB Jordan Howard's status as a fantasy starter. They play different roles, and the Bears need both of them -- particularly because they're so thin at receiver in the wake of injuries to Cameron Meredith and Kevin White. But Howard is nursing a shoulder injury this week, so Cohen's role could be bigger than usual.\n\n• ESPN Pittsburgh Steelers reporter Jeremy Fowler was kicking himself for not predicting tight end Jesse James' two-touchdown performance in Week 1. But hey, there are an awful lot of playmakers to spread the ball around to in Pittsburgh.\n\nThat's why Fowler is preaching cautious optimism with James, whom he described as a \"sizable over-the-middle target with good hops, slightly below-average speed and eagerness to break through in Year 3.\" Most important, though, Fowler pointed out that James and QB Ben Roethlisberger got a ton of reps together in goal-line work this summer.\n\n• ESPN New England Patriots reporter Mike Reiss said Mike Gillislee's usage (and his three touchdown runs) solidified his standing as LeGarrette Blount's replacement as New England's power back of choice.\n\n• Rookie Kenny Golladay didn't have a flawless performance in his NFL debut, and he's still the Detroit Lions' No. 3 receiver, behind Golden Tate and Marvin Jones. So ESPN Lions reporter Mike Rothstein has continued to preach realistic expectations for the 6-foot-4, 213-pounder. However, Golladay displayed his size, speed and catch radius with two impressive touchdown grabs, while proving he was worth all that preseason hype.\n\nOver/under\n\n• ESPN Cleveland Browns reporter Pat McManamon expects some highs and lows from rookie QB DeShone Kizer this season. Yet he couldn't help but notice Kizer all the way down at No. 26 in ESPN's weekly projections, and he thought it was worth stressing that Kizer has been \"really impressive\" for a rookie. McManamon said pre-draft concerns about arrogance have been the exact opposite of the balance and poise Kizer has shown so far, and he wrote that Kizer has continued to show that he \"gets it.\"\n\n• Tennessee Titans reporter Cameron Wolfe thinks DeMarco Murray's projections for Week 2 are a bit low (12 carries, 50 yards, 16th among running backs). Wolfe said there has been a lot of focus in Tennessee this week about getting back to the running game, and Murray remains the leading man, ahead of Derrick Henry (though Henry could earn more touches if he becomes the hot hand).\n\n• ESPN’s David Newton continues to think projections are too low for Carolina Panthers running back Jonathan Stewart (11 carries, 49 yards). Newton has been high on rookie runner/receiver Christian McCaffrey all summer, but he has continued to insist that Stewart will still have a big role in the offense. He was right in Week 1, when Stewart had 18 carries for 65 yards and two catches for 17 yards and a touchdown.\n\nWhat you need to know in the NFL\n\n• Statistics\n\n• Scoreboard\n\n• 2017 schedule, results\n\n• Standings\n\n• Los Angeles Chargers reporter Eric Williams isn't necessarily predicting the over on tight end Hunter Henry's projection of three catches and 36 yards. But Williams wrote about how neither Henry nor offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt seemed too concerned after Henry received zero targets in Week 1. That also happened in Week 16 of Henry's breakout rookie season in 2016.\n\n• I'm ESPN's New Orleans Saints reporter. And I can't offer too much optimism to Adrian Peterson's fantasy owners, because it's pretty clear the circumstances need to be just right for Peterson to get a steady number of touches (that is, not playing from behind, which could be a problem on Sunday against the Patriots). However, I will take the over on the rushing projections for both Peterson (seven carries, 30 yards) and Mark Ingram (eight carries, 38 yards). That's a pretty low bar that the Saints earned for themselves with an ugly rushing performance in Week 1.","author":"Mike TriplettESPN Staff Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T11:00:53.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F0930%2Fr12976_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"k9+dk9nYufpBYRX1LWCvBA==\n"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bdad1403c1c0e548b2c127"},"description":"If you're looking for the next big horror hit, here are 29 terrifying upcoming games to keep on your radar.","title":"29 Scariest Upcoming Horror Games - IGN","url":"http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/09/08/29-scariest-upcoming-horror-games","text":"Share. Horror on the horizon. Horror on the horizon.\n\nIt's been a surprisingly good year for horror games, with big-name hits like Resident Evil 7 and Outlast 2 sharing the spotlight with smaller-scale gems like Little Nightmares and Observer. But the year isn't over yet! There are tons of awesome horror games on the horizon for later this year, and plenty to look forward to in 2018 and beyond.\n\nBelow you'll find our list spotlighting 29 of the scariest looking upcoming horror games, from quiet, side-scrolling adventures with major Silent Hill vibes to spooky sci-fi ghost stories to some of the most violent and demonic hellscapes we've ever seen in a game before.\n\nNote: Since so many of these games are still in development, the platforms and release dates listed below are subject to change.\n\nAd Infinitum (PC)\n\nAs if World War I and the brutality of trench warfare weren't scary enough, Ad Infinitum adds in some Lovecraftian horror to the mix. We don't know much about this game outside of its terrifying reveal trailer, but based on what little we've seen, we're definitely on board.\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nAgony (PC, PS4, Xbox One)\n\nWhen it comes to depictions of hell in pop culture, Agony makes everything else look like a family-friendly amusement park. This is probably one of the most gruesome horror games in the making right now.\n\nRelease date: 2017\n\nAllison Road (PC)\n\nThe history of Allison Road has been rocky. It was announced, put on Kickstarter, taken off Kickstarter, cancelled, and then revived, but development has been pretty quiet since. Still, this P.T.-inspired first-person horror is one of the prettiest and spookiest games we've ever seen.\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nBendy and the Ink Machine: Chapter Three (PC)\n\nIf the smudged black-and-white and dead-eyed stare of old-timey cartoon characters have ever given you the creeps, Bendy and the Ink Machine is probably for you. The third chapter of this stylish, puzzle-heavy survival horror is due soon.\n\nRelease date: September 2017\n\nBlasphemous (PC)\n\nBlasphemous looks like a 2D, side-scrolling Bloodborne, and who doesn't want that? This chilling action-platformer has some of the most brutal violence and haunting boss fights we've seen rendered with such gorgeous pixel art. A lot of games have tried to capture the spirit of Dark Souls in 2D, but based on looks alone, Blasphemous is shaping up to be one of the best.\n\nRelease date: 2019\n\nCall of Cthulhu: The Official video Game (PC, PS4, Xbox One)\n\nThe full title of this one is kind of funny considering the existence of another very good Cthulhu game, Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth, but instead of simply adapting HP Lovecraft's most iconic story, Call of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game is also an adaptation of the tabletop board game.\n\nRelease date: 2017\n\nClose to the Sun (PC)\n\nThe techno-nautical art deco of Close to the Sun's steampunk-inspired setting feels a lot like Rapture from BioShock, if BioShock went even harder on the survival horror than the first-person shooting.\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nDays Gone (PS4)\n\nUnlike most zombie apocalypse stories, Days Gone is told from the perspective of a character who prefers the danger of a rogue lifestyle than the relative safety and security of a survivor's camp. It should be interesting to see what Days Gone can do with a genre that's been done to death (sorry) at this point, especially in a gorgeous open-world setting.\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nDead Matter (PC)\n\nAnother open-world zombie game, Dead Matter promises a deep survival experience involving crafting, hunting, farming, and even electrical engineering to keep your undead-proof base powered up against the apocalypse.\n\nDetention (PC, PS4)\n\nSet in Taiwan during the turbulent 1960s, Detention is a 2D side-scrolling horror game that feels closest in tone, atmosphere, and puzzle-solving to Silent Hill than most horror games that aspire to it. It's already out on Steam, but will be headed to PlayStation 4 sometime this year.\n\nRelease date: 2017\n\nThe Evil Within 2 (PC, PS4, Xbox One)\n\nThe highly-anticipated sequel to Shinji Mikami's ultraviolent 2014 survival horror, The Evil Within 2 looks even weirder and scarier than the original. Players take on the role of detective Sebastian Castellanos once again, as he ventures off to save his daughter and battle past traumas and new horrors along the way.\n\nRelease date: October 13, 2017\n\nGhost Theory (PC, PS4, Xbox One)\n\nGood old-fashioned ghosts are pretty overlooked in a lot of modern horror. Ghost Theory, on the other hand, is all about paranormal investigation, with several settings based on real-world \"haunted\" places.

That's even more true now that two of King's defining works, The Dark Tower and It, have made their way to the big screen within weeks of each other. And while The Dark Tower wasn't quite the rousing fantasy epic fans were hoping, Stephen King's IT has already made a huge splash.\n\nTo celebrate these new releases, we've updated our ranking of the best movies based on Stephen King stories.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bdad1e03c1c0e548b2c12f"},"description":"A fitting end to a fantastic story that shakes things up while still scratching the Dishonored itch.","title":"Dishonored: Death of the Outsider Review - IGN","url":"http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/09/16/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-review","text":"Share. Hello from the outside. Hello from the outside.\n\nBy the very nature of its roots in the amazing Dishonored 2, Dishonored: Death of the Outsider was already well on its way to being a great game. I was overjoyed to drop back into the city of Karnaca and try on a new set of supernatural assassin abilities, even if the things I did there weren’t quite as compelling this time around.\n\nDeath of the Outsider puts you in control of the charming but troubled Billie Lurk, who is helping her now old and dying mentor Daud get revenge on the black-eyed god behind all the magic happenings since the Dishonored series began: the Outsider. It aims to tie a neat little bow on the story arc that started with Jessamine Kaldwin’s murder in the first Dishonored, though it’s unusually light on story itself.\n\nApart from some brief exposition between missions, there’s really not much more going on here than a quest for a mystical MacGuffin item that can kill the Outsider. It’s straightforward, but still a satisfying way to end this five-year arc. With Daud’s strength fading, Billie sets out to do the job with a creepy new bone arm, a red eye straight out of Terminator, and some cool new powers.\n\nLurk Before You Leap\n\nYour main movement ability is called Displace, and it opens up some great new opportunities for magical ninja mischief and murder. Instead of just teleporting to a location as Corvo does with Blink, you drop a ghostly image of yourself wherever you’re aiming. You can then reactivate Displace to hop to the ghost, as long as you have line-of-sight and aren’t too far away. This lets you double-click to use it similarly to Blink, or you can pull off some cool tricks like setting Displace on a ledge, dropping down to pickpocket someone, then immediately teleport back to safety before they can turn around.\n\nDisplace is complemented by Foresight, Billie’s brilliant replacement for Dark Vision. Instead of being able to see through walls in real time, Foresight freezes time and lets you fly around the map, marking targets and scouting out the area around you, draining your Void energy as you go. You can also drop a ghost to jump to with Displace once Foresight ends, effectively extending its range - though it was a little tedious to have to use it every time a ledge was just barely too far away for a regular Displace.\n\nThe real success of Foresight is that I no longer felt the need to constantly check for enemies in the ugly but irresistibly overpowered world of Dark Vision. I would use Foresight, take a look around, mark enemies, then play through the area I had just scouted in my regular view. It’s truly freeing, somehow feeling like both a stronger ability and one I didn’t need to rely on nearly as much.\n\nThe third and final ability is Semblance, which lets you knock people out and disguise yourself as them, Hitman style – and naturally spending energy whenever you move. It’s an interesting ability with some gorgeous visual effects accompanying it (including magically slurping off your victim’s face like an iPhone X-like facial scan), but I rarely used it. Whenever I stole a face to sneak through a guarded point, I usually found myself standing still about to run out of energy with nowhere to hide and no way to Displace. It didn’t suit my playstyle, but it’s still a neat tool to have available.\n\n“ Going lethal or non-lethal is now entirely a matter of personal preference.\n\nDespite being exciting abilities, all three of them were a bit played out by the end of the roughly eight-hour campaign, due in part to the fact that they’re all handed to you right after the first mission. Apart from a new attack, there were no new abilities or items to unlock, and there’s no way to upgrade or alter your powers except for a few Bone Charms that don’t make a radical difference. With only five major missions, I get that there isn’t a whole lot of space for deep progression, but not being able to modify my abilities more significantly was a bummer.\n\nWild and Crazy Kills\n\nThankfully, Death of the Outsider makes a few changes that gave me more freedom to use the abilities I did have. Your Void energy will refill automatically no matter how often you use abilities, instead of having to use elixirs to top yourself off. This meant I could get reckless and fast with my Displace jumps, which felt great after having to carefully time and space out abilities in Dishonored 2.\n\nThe other huge change is that there’s no more Chaos system, which I have mixed feelings about. Going the lethal or non-lethal route is now entirely a matter of personal preference with no ultimate effect on the game world or the outcome of the story. It makes sense given the shorter campaign length, and it was refreshing to have more freedom to make a mistake and not feel the immediate need to quickload. But it also undermines the allure of a full non-lethal approach, as it now seems like more of a self-imposed challenge rather than a playstyle that levels were designed for.\n\nThe lack of a Chaos system did free up space for some interesting Contract side missions. One required I kill literally every guard (over 50 of them) during a mission to collect my reward. That followed a Contract on the previous mission that wanted me to remain completely undetected. Those clashing goals generally couldn’t both be completed in a single run for previous Dishonored games, so I like that the lack of a Chaos system let Death of the Outsider encourage varied styles without having to start a new save file. I’m not sure I would want to play a full-length Dishonored game without consequences for killing, but it was a lot of fun in this context.\n\n“ No level stands out like Dishonored 2’s Clockwork Mansion, but they’re still compelling to explore.\n\nOn the other hand, violence not affecting the story, combined with Billie’s only real goal being to end the Outsider, had the disappointing result of all the more prominent targets along the way being rather inconsequential. In fact, there aren’t any “targets” as you’d think of them in other Dishonored games. There are named characters that you usually need to steal something from, like the pompous singer Shan Yun or the extortionist bank director Dolores Michaels, but whether you leave them dead or alive is mostly irrelevant.\n\nThe levels these characters reside in are much more interesting. They’re wonderfully detailed, with care and creativity poured into every nook and cranny. Guards and civilians chatter about these people and their surroundings, sharing backstory and making them feel like real parts of the world. I particularly liked the Conservatory mission, which takes place in what felt like a large museum controlled by Overseers, with glass cases full of animals and oddities scattered all over it. None of the levels are standout successes like Dishonored 2’s Clockwork Mansion, but they’re still compelling to explore and conquer.\n\nDolores’ Bank could have been that standout mission, taking place in a rich and lavish building with a seriously awesome elevator vault to break into. But an optional objective I’d completed knocked out every single guard and employee before I entered, which turned what might’ve been a great mission into just a lot of walking safely around that space. I ended up regretting a decision Death of the Outsider encouraged me to make, which didn’t feel great.\n\nThat being said, given its shorter overall length, an ‘Original Game+’ mode that lets Billie use abilities from Dishonored 2, and a custom difficulty mode that lets you toy with over 20 different options like footstep noise and enemy bravery, most of these missions feel like challenges meant to be replayed, encouraging experimentation with new routes and harder difficulties instead of getting caught up in moral decision making.\n\nIn general, Death of the Outsider feels like an extension of Dishonored 2, which it pretty much is despite being sold as a standalone game instead of an expansion. It doesn’t mess up what made its predecessor great, and thankfully ran significantly better on PC at launch for me (I maxed it out on a GTX 1070, and it still ran great on a GTX 970), but it also ends up being a flatter version of an incredible game.\n\nDishonored: Death of the Outsider An extension chapter in the action-packed franchise, Dishonored: Death of the Outsider puts players in the role of Billie Lurk, who is on a mission to kill the series' mysterious Outsider, along with Empress assassin, Daud.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bdad2303c1c0e548b2c132"},"description":"How is Netflix's new mockumentary, about a student expelled for genitalia graffiti, the best mystery on TV? By diving into drama instead of the jokes.","title":"American Vandal: Season 1 Review - IGN","url":"http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/09/15/american-vandal-season-1-review","text":"Share. Mystery Meat. Mystery Meat.\n\nThis is a full non-spoiler review for all 8 episodes of Netflix's new series American Vandal - out Friday, September 15th.\n\nOne thing I'm pretty sure we're all hyper-aware of right now is that there's a lot of TV. Too much TV, some could easily argue. You've still got your huge hits like Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead but from there everyone's personal viewing schedules and preferences splinter and vary. Adding to all this is Netflix spending billions so they can launch dozens of new shows, sometimes in a single month, with no hype or push behind them. They just sort of land and it's then up to us to discover them. Stranger Things, back in the summer of 2016, certainly had a unique hook, but there was little-to-no advertising for it beforehand. It just blew up.\n\nI don't think American Vandal is going to explode in the same way as Stranger Things, no, but I am here to attempt to, I suppose, sell you on it. To let you know why adding this under-the-radar series to your watch list, over perhaps some other under-the-radar shows, is worth your time. That's not to say that some of you haven't heard about American Vandal already because it's not like it's been totally invisible, but it's certainly not what you'd consider one of Netflix's high profile properties.\n\nVandal doesn't come with big stars or creators and it's sort saddled with the \"mockumentary\" label. Also with the Funny or Die label, which isn't a terrible thing except that having Will Ferrell and Adam McKay production house as a backer adds the expectation that this is a comedy, and it isn't - for the most part. One more layer here - the premise involves taking the \"Making a Murderer\" docu-format (creating an in-house Netflix skewering) and spotlighting a burnout teen expelled from his school for spray-painting 27 faculty member cars with giant penises. Yes, \"Who Drew the D***s?\" is the tagline here so how can you not expect, going in, for Vandal to be one overlong d*** joke.\n\nAs you can see, Vandal, right out of the gate, finds itself in a polite fist fight with our base expectations. The trick here though, even the biggest joke if you will, is that the show plays it straight. This is not a gag. This is not a goof. You can loosely call American Vandal a satire because it is aping a particular style, like the Serial podcast and the aforementioned \"Making a Murderer\" (or even crime docs before those like Errol Morris' The Thin Blue Line or the West Memphis Three Paradise Lost saga), but it's still a stretch.\n\nIf anything, Vandal is an earnest parody of those shows, with way less \"mock\" than you expect for a \"mockumentary\" about dong drawings. It's fake, yes, and it's certainly undercutting the solemn \"life or death\" seriousness of the shows it's styled after, but it's also one of the most engaging mysteries and thrillers on TV right now and one of the best new shows of the fall.\n\nAmerican Vandal: Season 1 Photos 9 IMAGES Fullscreen Image Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC 01 OF 9 01 OF 9 American Vandal: Season 1 Photos Download Image Captions ESC\n\nAre there laughs? Most definitely, but they don't come as frequently as you expect or from easy to spot comedy set-ups. What's more fascinating here -- and it took me a good ten minutes before I realized that American Vandal was treating its story seriously -- is the deep and wonderful exploration of high school. In this instance, Hanover High in Oceanside, California stands in as the average all-American suburban school experience.\n\nEvery student character here, from the delinquents to the brains to the princesses to the whatever other sort of Breakfast Club labels you want to throw around, are well-rounded complex individuals who take their lives seriously. One of the major sticking points that American Vandal makes by delving into this particular mystery is how often kids in school are written off and too-easily categorized by both teachers and their fellow students because it's the easiest and laziest way to engage with someone else. High School can be hell because that's when society, for the first time, places you in some sort of box.\n\nAt the center of the story, and the fake American Vandal documentary, is Dylan Maxwell (played perfectly, and with unexpected nuance, by YouTube star Jimmy Tatro). Dylan, as a senior, has such a poor reputation as both a prankster and a pain in the ass at school that no one's surprised when he's kicked out for a serious and costly \"joke\" that involves the painting of d***s all over teachers' cars. One student claims to have seen him do it, a teacher says she was the one specifically targeted, and the rest is history. The school doesn't need hard evidence to kick Dylan to the curb but Dylan's Hanover Morning Show classmates, Peter (Tyler Alvarez) and Sam (Griffin Gluck) WILL need solid proof in order to clear Dylan's name. Though, to be fair, Peter insists multiple times that he's not making a documentary in order to save Dylan, just to discover the truth, as occasionally the investigation leads Peter back to Dylan and his casual thoughtless lies.\n\nOne of the benefits of this being a fake mystery, naturally, is that it's all going to be crafted (by creators Tony Yacenda and Dan Perrault) like a really engaging TV show with a beginning, middle and end. In true-to-Noir style, Peter's going to discover side conspiracies that have nothing to do with the vandalism case directly, but still add to the overall texturing of the school and student body. He'll go down wrong paths and chase leads that don't pan out, but then everything winds up circling back in the end to expose bigger revelations. This is all crafted to work as a solid \"whodunnit?\" and at the heart of it, if you're wondering about the stakes, is the potential ruin of a young man's life. American Vandal is awesome because it makes us, at times, question whether or not Dylan, being the dope that he is, is worth all the trouble. We then have to examine how easily it is for us, even as viewers, to write someone off as a future failure at age 17.\n\nAmerican Vandal is surprisingly intense and addictive. As Peter's findings draw him into possible misdeeds and felonies committed by teachers and faculty, or even debates over the validity of summer camp flings and hookups (using 3D renderings and recreations of alleged sexual encounters), you'll find yourself becoming really invested in everyone's life and appreciating moments both big and small. From the stupidity-bordering-on genius of Dylan's online pranks with his Wayback Boys buds (like \"Baby Farting,\" where they run up and fart on babies) to the little beats where Peter and Sam are noticeably nervous and tongue-tied when tasked with interviewing teachers about serious subject matters. All the while, Peter's own issues, and how he feels more comfortable being cold and detached from everyone than actually facing his feelings and fully acknowledging the mistreatment of his classmates for the sake of his movie, starts to surface more and give the entire project a different feel.\n\nAmerican Vandal: Season 1 Get Deal","author":"Matt Fowler","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-15T16:27:09.000Z"},"source":"ign","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/09/15/americanvandal-1280-1505485664656_1280w.jpg","digest":"ZFC/y9FhKE6T3zO1BED7Yg==\n"}

These occur at specific areas on each destination, and their location can be seen from the map.\n\nNot only that but after a short amount of time they can be manually started by interacting with the flag located in the area. These can vary from destroying a fallen walker to taking out waves of enemies.\n\nEditHeroic Events\n\n\n\nMost public events have a Heroic modifier that can be added to the event if a specific set of actions are performed during the event. Triggering a Heroic Event will increase the difficulty of the event, but it will also boost the experience gains and loot rewards at the end of it.\n\nBelow are the triggers for each Heroic Event.\n\nFIND A HEROIC EVENT TRIGGER WE HAVEN'T?\n\nClick the edit button at the top of this page to add it!\n\n\n\nEditGlimmer Drill\n\nThis event is usually found on Earth, and has Guardians repel a dangerous Fallen mining operation. To complete this event normally, players must kill the four marked Elites guarding the drill before the time runs out.\n\nTo trigger the heroic version, destroy the extractor - the small devices that beam light to the drill - at all three drill sites.\n\nEditDestroy the Devil Walker\n\nOn Titan you can often catch Fallen attempting to transport weapons. When this event occurs, three Scorch Cannons will spawn behind shields and you'll need to eliminate an Arsenal Walker tank.\n\nTo trigger the Heroic version of this public event, you'll need to use these Scorch Cannons. Each time you damage the Walker enough to expose it's \"neck,\" the tank will drop Arc Charges that can be deposited into the generators on either side of the shields surrounding the cannons.\n\nPlace one arc charge in each generator to disable the shield and collect the Scorch Cannon. At this point, another Arsenal Walker will be transported into the field - worry not, though, these new super weapons will make quick work of them both.\n\nEditVex Tower Construction\n\n\n\nOn Nessus, you’ll encounter a Vex construction event. To complete the event normally, you need only defend against the incoming Vex and prevent them from reinforcing their structures belowground. To add the Heroic event, you'll need to do a bit of extra leg work.\n\nThe central Vex structure shoots out three beams of light which can be followed until you find a circular plate with a pole in the middle. Stand on the plates as you would on a control point in The Crucible and capture each area for yourselves. Be aware this will spawn several elite Vex enemies as well as a Hydra construct.\n\nEditCabal Excavation\n\nThis event tasks you with capturing a mining lander while enduring aerial bombardment from a Cabal warship.\n\nDuring the event, a lone Cabal dropship will sporadically fly around the area, occasionally stopping to shoot at you and your fireteam. Destroy this small dropship to enable the heroic event (don’t fret if it flies away after you first exchange as it will return for a second pass). Once it's destroyed, an Honored Colossus will spawn as the Heroic modifier.\n\nEditCabal Injection rig\n\n\n\nThe normal objective for this event is to kill Psions until the Infiltrator Valus enemy appears. In order begin the Heroic version of the mission, you and your fireteam will need to destroy the open heat vents on the top, middle and bottom levels of the Injection Rig as they open.\n\nEditEther Resupply\n\nIn this public event you’ll encounter a giant fallen servitor which will spawn smaller servitors to protect it with a shield.\n\nSimply destroy all the small transport servitors before they disappear to activate the heroic mode - you’ll need to make clever use of your super when it spawns more than one at a time, depending on how many players are taking part in the event.\n\nEditTaken Blight\n\nThe Banish the Taken Blight event has you killing taken enemies until the Blight % reaches zero.\n\nIn order to trigger the Heroic version of the event, keep dipping in and then out of the Taken \"domes\" or \"bubbles,\" then attacking the large central Blight while you have the Blight Receding buff active. This is the only way to damage the central Blight, and you need to destroy it to trigger the Heroic modifier and eliminate the Blightmaker that appears.\n\nEditWitches Ritual\n\nThis event on Titan normally has you trying to defeat a powerful Abyssal Wizard. To trigger the Heroic modifier, eliminate the two Ritual Witches as you normally would, then stand in the circle of runes (they glow green at the start of the event) and fire on the small crystals at the top corners of the portal until they're destroyed.\n\nOnce the Heroic modifier has been triggered, you'll need to defeat the Abyssal Champion to complete the event.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T22:50:27.000Z"},"source":"ign","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/05/27/contentplaceholderpng-967b4c.png","digest":"WXyBwHXJoLN8kTqKVW32sg==\n"}

Measuring it against what comes first is -- to..","title":"A brief recent history of Apple’s product swerves","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/16/a-brief-recent-history-of-apples-product-swerves/","text":"The perennial refrain of Android fans is that Apple is just adding stuff to iOS that they’ve had for years already in their mobile ecosystem. And it’s certainly true that Cupertino makes a point of waiting until it believes a technology is properly baked and the time is juuuuust right — or at least commercially judicious — to introduce a new product or capability, one which has likely already been in widespread use across the mobile platform aisle.\n\nHence the company is often charged with being an innovation laggard. While its senior execs are always fielding questions about why such and such a product or feature isn’t in Apple’s line-up yet.\n\nThe company’s strategy for, you could say, mismanaging expectation has seen it frequently swing from publicly rubbishing a device type or technology — to warmly embracing it a few years later. (Or, well, not, in the case of Flash.)\n\nSteve Jobs was master of this dark marketing art. You don’t usually see his more mild-mannered replacement, Tim Cook, deploying the kind of extended public trashtalking that Jobs indulged, raging out at this or that rival tech as ludicrous, impossible to use and horribly designed. Before performing a complete U-turn down the line.\n\nCook mostly limits himself to getting a bit fired up about Android security and fragmentation during keynotes. But the current Apple CEO has still presided over some major swerves in its position on tech developments — from finally inflating the screen size of the iPhone, in 2014, to adding and (now) extending support for NFC, as well as introducing wireless charging in its newest iPhone 8/8 Plus and iPhone X models.\n\nHe was also at the helm when Apple outed a stylus for its iPad Pro line — braving the inexorable flak given Jobs’ very public loathing for such sticks (among many jabs at styli, Jobs left us this choice quote: “If you need a stylus you’ve already failed”).\n\nThe lesson here is that Apple has always said — and will always say — whatever it needs to in public as it bides its time, continues its analysis and waits until its target mainstream market will appreciate the utility of what it’s developing. As Jobs also used to say, the things Apple chooses not to do are as important to what it does include in the products.\n\nAnd of course it does not always get this balancing act right. It was, after all, rather slow to increase smartphone screen size and move into the phablet space. Yet at the same time lots of iPhone users clearly liked the four-inch handset form factor, hence Apple subsequently re-introducing it, with the iPhone SE.\n\nA more major misjudgment came in 2013 when it tried to offer a plastic-backed iPhone, aka the iPhone 5c. The market responded with a resounding: no thanks! — and the model was quietly discontinued. (Perhaps because offering a cheaper build material went against Apple’s grain of expanding the pool of technological innovations it offers users.)\n\nBut any statements the company makes that appear intended to rubbish rival innovations should be read as a placeholder signal which states: yes Apple is interested, yes Apple is looking, yes Apple is probably testing and prototyping; but no Apple, is not yet ready to take the plunge.\n\nApple did not make the first personal computer, nor the first tablet computer, nor the first smartphone. Measuring it against what comes first is — to paraphrase Jobs — a boneheaded way of looking at the company. Rather its energy is spun up and spent on doing the hard assessment work of figuring out how to make key technology innovations accessible and usable across the broadest audience. From toddlers to senior citizens.\n\nAnd the mass consumer adoption of these technologies is the real innovative heart of Apple.\n\nSo when this refining modus operandi means the company has to publicly change course and contradict something it’s said before, its execs don’t even feel the need to break a sweat. Because this is the reality of the task they’ve set themselves — to guide consumers one more rung up the tech ladder.\n\nThat’s the kind of engineering business Apple is in.\n\nOLED displays\n\n2013, Tim Cook: “Some people use OLED displays, but the colour saturation is awful. If you ever buy anything online and really want to know what he color is, as many people do, you should really think twice before you depend on the color from an OLED display.”\n\n2017, Phil Schiller: “This is the first OLED display great enough to be in an iPhone.”\n\nWireless charging\n\n2012, Phil Schiller: “Having to create another device you have to plug into the wall is actually, for most situations, more complicated.”\n\n2017, Phil Schiller: “Words can’t describe just how much nicer it is to just put it down and pick it up whenever you want to charge without every having to plug in a cable again.”\n\nNFC\n\n2013, Craig Federighi, touting Apple AirDrop as a better alternative to NFC: “No need to wander around the room, bumping your phone… [mimes bumping phones]”\n\nSeptember 2014, Eddie Cue: “We’ve got a groundbreaking NFC antenna built across the top… Apple Pay is easy and secure and it’s private.”\n\nSeptember 2014, Tim Cook, on Apple Pay: “It is so cool!”\n\n2017: Apple (quietly) expands NFC support in iOS 11 beyond Apple Pay — to enable it to read NFC tags in the real world\n\nLarger displays\n\n2013, Tim Cook: “The iPhone 5 offers… a new four-inch retina display, which is the most advanced display in the industry. It also provides a larger screen size without sacrificing the one-handed ease of use that our customers love.”\n\n2014, Tim Cook, introducing iPhone 6 and 6 Plus: “Today we are launching the biggest advancement in the history of iPhone.”\n\n2014, Phil Schiller: “Yes, they’re bigger. They’re a lot bigger… Your photos look gorgeous and there’s more to see on each of them.\n\n“And when you turn them in landscape we show more as well. And we took special advantage of the iPhone 6 Plus because of all those pixels to do some new things with our apps. So, for example, the messages app now has a new horizontal two-up display… We do everything to take advantage of these huge displays to make them more capable.”\n\nThird party keyboard apps\n\n2013, Tim Cook, asked about opening up iOS keyboard for third party apps: “I think you’ll see us open up more in future, but not to the degree that we’ll put the customer at risk of having a bad experience.”\n\n2014, Craig Federighi, introducing the ability to install system-wide third party keyboards: “So now if you have a special keyboard you want to use you can install those on iOS, and by default those of course run inside of the most restricted sandbox with no network access, because we want to make sure to protect your privacy. But if that keyboard requires or you want to grant it ability it can ask for access to the network to provide extended functionality. We put those controls in your hands.”\n\nSmart speakers\n\nMay 2017, Phil Schiller on being asked about the Amazon Echo and Google Home: “My mother used to have a saying that if you don’t have something nice to say, say nothing at all.\n\n“There’s many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn’t mean you’d never want a screen. So the idea of not having a screen, I don’t think suits many situations.”\n\nJune 2017, Phil Schiller: “This is really exciting. The chance to reinvent the way we enjoy music in the home. I can’t think of anything that matters more to so many of us.”\n\nStylus\n\n2007, Steve jobs: “Who wants a stylus? You have to get em and put em away and you lose em. Yeuck! Nobody wants a stylus.”\n\n2015, Phil Schiller: “It’s called Apple Pencil… It’s one of the most advanced technologies we’ve ever created, in a simple, beautiful form.”\n\niPad Mini\n\n2010, Steve Jobs, on 7-inch tablets needing to include “sandpaper so that your user could sand down their fingers to one-quarter of their present size”.\n\n“There are clear limits on how you can physically place elements on a touchscreen before users can not reliably tap, flick or pinch them. This is why we think that the 10-inch screen size is the minimum size required to create great tablet apps.”\n\n2012, Phil Schiller: “What can you do with an iPad mini that you can’t already do with the amazing Fourth Generation iPad? Well this — you can hold it in one hand.”\n\n“This isn’t just a shrunken down iPad; it’s an entirely new design… There is nothing as amazing as this.”","author":"Natasha Lomas","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T17:00:57.000Z"},"source":"techcrunch","urlToImage":"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-14-at-5-09-32-pm.png","digest":"O4WjfBkP2cqMLmeocI/dTQ==\n"}

In the latest development, authorities are now investigating how agents used online advertising on social networks and search platforms, and tech companies are being forced to hand over new, sensitive information to investigators as a result.\n\nIn some cases, that means providing different information to different investigations, as The Wall Street Journal is reporting today.\n\nFacebook has apparently turned over more detailed information to the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, than the company shared with Congress last week, the Journal reports.\n\nMueller’s investigation has received copies of the Russian-bought ads and details about the specific account information and targeting criteria the buyers used to distribute their ads, according to the Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nIt’s likely that Facebook was compelled to turn over the information because the investigating team received a search warrant.\n\nIf indeed, Mueller is using warrants, then it’s likely that Facebook won’t be the only tech company that may be forced to reveal information about potential clandestine advertising buys, which Russian agents are alleged to have made in order to influence the U.S. election.\n\nThe Journal reports that Mueller’s team could have gotten information that Facebook withheld from Congress because of concerns around privacy laws or fears of disrupting the Mueller probe. My guess is that Facebook is likely also thinking that the Mueller investigation is a tighter ship and less likely to leak details of the ads whereas Congressional staffers could leak like sieves.\n\nIt’s clear that Facebook has no interest in revealing details of the ad buys, or telling individuals whether they were targets of what amounts to a Russian plot to influence the U.S. election.\n\nIt’s something members of the tech community have taken Facebook to task for already.\n\nSecret political ads are by definition an attack on democracy. Their disclosure is not optional. Shocking FB continues to insist otherwise. — Pierre Omidyar (@pierre) September 9, 2017\n\nWe’ve reached out to the Office of the Special Counsel and for comment and will update if we hear back.\n\nLast week Facebook revealed that it had sold as much as $150,000 in political ads to pro-Kremlin entities between 2015 and 2017.\n\nIt was part of a broader report that indicated 500 “inauthentic” accounts linked to Russia had purchased 5,000 ads from the company. The developments today relate to that same trove but are a sign of yet more data now being handed over to authorities.\n\nLast Wednesday, as the company released its assessment, Facebook representatives also spoke to Congress as part of ongoing House and Senate investigations into Russian interference in the election. Facebook even told The Washington Post, “there is evidence that some of the accounts are linked to a troll farm in St. Petersburg, referred to as the Internet Research Agency, though we have no way to independently confirm.”\n\nAs we reported, the Internet Research Agency is widely known for its pro-Kremlin online propaganda campaigns, which U.S. intelligence agencies believe is backed by someone with close ties to the Russian intelligence community who is a close friend of Vladimir Putin’s.\n\nFacebook’s disclosure was the first time it admitted that Russians had reached out to voters during the elections. The company had previously denied that there were any ad buys made by Russian agents or anyone connected with the Russian government.\n\nAll of these discoveries and announcements come amid serious questions about the role of Russia in the last election … and whether the President Donald Trump’s campaign (or people associated with that campaign) colluded with the Russian government.\n\nCommittees in both houses are writing up reports on the role Russia played in the election.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Facebook isn’t the only social media company to come under fire for either unwittingly or knowingly playing a role in disseminating propaganda on behalf of a foreign government.\n\nTwitter is also expected to come before congressional inquisitors in the coming weeks, according to a report from Reuters last week, quoting Democratic Senator Mark Warner.\n\n“It was my belief that the Russians were using those sites to interfere in our elections, and the first reaction from Facebook was, ‘No. You’re crazy.’” Warner said at the Intelligence and National Security Alliance conference in Washington. “I think what we saw yesterday in terms of their brief was the tip of the iceberg,” Warner said. He also told reporters he expected Twitter to soon brief the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the panels investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and whether members of President Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow.\n\nFacebook has been reluctant to share any details with the public and have extended that reticence to the Congressional investigators that are looking into Russian interference. The Journal reported that Facebook believes the data on ads could be protected under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.\n\nBi-partisan leadership from the Senate Intelligence Committee is pushing for company representatives to come to Capitol Hill and publicly walk Senators through how potential Russian agents came to advertise on the company’s social network.\n\nThe Senate could compel Facebook executives to show up by issuing a subpoena… But subpoena power to testify is not the same as a warrant. Search warrants have more legal force behind them and mean that the company has to disclose more information than it would in live testimony.","author":"Jonathan Shieber","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T01:30:55.000Z"},"source":"techcrunch","urlToImage":"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-699353624.jpg","digest":"Xi7UfvyRfOLV/g/yDp0s+Q==\n"}

As people have parsed just how serious Apple is about it, questions have rightly begun to be raised about its effectiveness, security and creation.\n\nTo get some answers, I hopped on the phone with Apple’s SVP of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi. We went through a bunch of the common concerns in rapid-fire fashion, and I’ve also been asking around and listening to Apple folks who have been using the feature over long periods. Hopefully we can clear up some of the FUD about it.\n\nMaking Face ID\n\nOnstage during the event, Apple’s Phil Schiller mentioned that Apple had gathered “a billion” images to train Face ID. Federighi says that Apple went even further than that.\n\n“Phil mentioned that we’d gathered a billion images and that we’d done data gathering around the globe to make sure that we had broad geographic and ethnic data sets. Both for testing and validation for great recognition rates,” says Federighi. “That wasn’t just something you could go pull off the internet.”\n\nEspecially given that the data needed to include a high-fidelity depth map of facial data. So, says Federighi, Apple went out and got consent from subjects to provide scans that were “quite exhaustive.” Those scans were taken from many angles and contain a lot of detail that was then used to train the Face ID system.\n\nI asked what Apple did with that training data.\n\n“We do retain a high-fidelity depth map of that [training] data that we protect,” says Federighi. “As we train these models and iterate on these algorithms you want raw sensor data to use and develop and optimize them.”\n\nWhen it comes to customers — users — Apple gathers absolutely nothing itself. Federighi was very explicit on this point.\n\n“We do not gather customer data when you enroll in Face ID, it stays on your device, we do not send it to the cloud for training data,” he notes.\n\nThere is an adaptive feature of Face ID that allows it to continue to recognize your changing face as you change hair styles, grow a beard or have plastic surgery. This adaptation is done completely on device by applying re-training and deep learning in the redesigned Secure Enclave. None of that training or re-training is done in Apple’s cloud. And Apple has stated that it will not give access to that data to anyone, for any price.\n\nWhich is a good a time as any to talk about another big topic: security.\n\nThe security and privacy of Face ID\n\nOne of the primary questions about Face ID that has come from many quarters is how Apple is going to handle law enforcement requests for facial data.\n\nThe simple answer, which is identical to the answer for Touch ID, by the way, is that Apple does not even have a way to give it to law enforcement. Apple never takes possession of the data, anonymized or otherwise. When you train the data it gets immediately stored in the Secure Enclave as a mathematical model that cannot be reverse-engineered back into a “model of a face.” Any re-training also happens there. It’s on your device, in your SE, period.\n\nThis answers questions about whether Apple is taking stewardship of the data of underage users in the U.S. as well. It isn’t. It stays on device.\n\nI also asked Federighi whether Apple had considered allowing the very security-conscious to enable a mode that forced both Face ID and a passcode to be used to unlock a device. A sort of two-factor identification that combined both numeric and biometric factors into one system.\n\n“We’ve definitely talked about it internally,” says Federighi. “We have people who are interested [in that].”\n\nHe points out that there are scenarios you’d need to account for, like shaving your “mountain man” beard and needing access. “The thing we’d need to do is you’d need a backup super-long passcode… but it’s certainly something that gets discussed.”\n\nSo, not for now, but the topic has come up.\n\nI also quizzed Federighi about the exact way you “quick disabled” Face ID in tricky scenarios — like being stopped by police, or being asked by a thief to hand over your device.\n\n“On older phones the sequence was to click 5 times [on the power button], but on newer phones like iPhone 8 and iPhone X, if you grip the side buttons on either side and hold them a little while — we’ll take you to the power down [screen]. But that also has the effect of disabling Face ID,” says Federighi. “So, if you were in a case where the thief was asking to hand over your phone — you can just reach into your pocket, squeeze it, and it will disable Face ID. It will do the same thing on iPhone 8 to disable Touch ID.”\n\nThat squeeze can be of either volume button plus the power button. This, in my opinion, is an even better solution than the “5 clicks” because it’s less obtrusive. When you do this, it defaults back to your passcode.\n\nThis is a bit of an aside, but I’d also like to point out here that Face ID emits no visible light. I’ve seen some misconceptions on social media that it’s going to be shining a light at your face. Nope. It uses only infrared and existing light, which means it will work in darkness without any more light than is coming off of the phone’s screen.\n\nIt’s worth noting a few additional details here:\n\nIf you haven’t used Face ID in 48 hours, or if you’ve just rebooted, it will ask for a passcode.\n\nIf there are 5 failed attempts to Face ID, it will default back to passcode. (Federighi has confirmed that this is what happened in the demo onstage when he was asked for a passcode — it tried to read the people setting the phones up on the podium.)\n\nDevelopers do not have access to raw sensor data from the Face ID array. Instead, they’re given a depth map they can use for applications like the Snap face filters shown onstage. This can also be used in ARKit applications.\n\nhave access to raw sensor data from the Face ID array. Instead, they’re given a depth map they can use for applications like the Snap face filters shown onstage. This can also be used in ARKit applications. You’ll also get a passcode request if you haven’t unlocked the phone using a passcode or at all in 6.5 days and if Face ID hasn’t unlocked it in 4 hours.\n\nAlso be prepared for your phone to immediately lock every time your sleep/wake button is pressed or it goes to sleep on its own. This is just like Touch ID.\n\nFederighi also noted on our call that Apple would be releasing a security white paper on Face ID closer to the release of the iPhone X. So if you’re a researcher or security wonk looking for more, he says it will have “extreme levels of detail” about the security of the system.\n\nUsing Face ID\n\nThen there’s the topic of how well it works. Everyone I’ve spoken to who has been in a position to be using it for weeks or months says it’s incredibly reliable no matter the light level. The combination of using the RGB camera and the IR emitter plus the dot projector covers a wide array of scenarios that allow it to be very reliable and very fast.\n\nOne anecdotal thing: If you lift your phone and swipe up immediately, there’s a good chance that the Face ID system will have performed its authentication fast enough to have unlocked your device by the time you finish your swipe. That’s how fast it is.\n\nBut the speed isn’t the only question. Sunglasses, for instance, are fairly commonly worn outdoors. Federighi had mentioned in an email to a user that “most” sunglasses would work fine. I asked whether polarization was the problem. He said no.\n\n“It turns out that polarization isn’t the issue — I have a set of polarized sunglasses that work just fine with Face ID. What it is is that different lenses have a different amount of infrared filtration. Most let enough IR through that through most lenses your eyes are visible to IR even if they’re not visible to the human eye,” says Federighi. “There are some lenses whose coatings block IR. In those cases the customer can just use a passcode or take them off.”\n\nHe notes there are some people for whom the “attention” feature just won’t work. If you’re blind or vision impaired for instance, you may not be able to stare directly at the phone to communicate your intent. In those cases, where a face is recognized (even with sunglasses on), but it can’t see your eyes, you can just turn off the “attention detection” feature. You still get Face ID, but at a lower level of overall security because it’s not ensuring that your eyes are directly focused on it.\n\n“You can turn off attention detection as a user,” says Federighi. “There’s some compromise to detection there — but if you have a condition where you can’t look at it, that’s the choice you have. And if you don’t want to use the Face ID feature at all, you can turn it off.”\n\nFace ID requires that it be able to see your eyes, nose and mouth. This means there are scenarios where it just won’t work.\n\n“If you’re a surgeon or someone who wears a garment that covers your face, it’s not going to work,” says Federighi. “But if you’re wearing a helmet or scarf, it works quite well.”\n\nThis means that Face ID is not going to be a viable option for people who wear a mask for work or wear a niqab, for instance. They would need to use a passcode. Federighi notes that this limitation is similar to Touch ID, which simply didn’t work if you wore gloves or had wet fingers.\n\nAnother common question is about what kind of angles and distances you can be at in relation to your iPhone to get it to unlock.\n\n“It’s quite similar to the ranges you’d be at if you put your phone in front-facing camera mode [to take a picture],” says Federighi. Once your space from eyes to mouth come into view that would be the matching range — it can work at fairly extreme angles — if it’s down low because your phone is in your lap it can unlock it as long as it can see those features. Basically, If you’re using your phone across a natural series of angles it can unlock it.”\n\nObviously, those angles are limited because it tries to use the attention detection system to match that you’re not just in your phone’s view while it is awake, but that you’re actively trying to use it. This is why it won’t work when you’re asleep if someone tries to unlock your phone, or if you’re talking to someone and a third party tries to point the phone at your face to unlock it. You have to be paying attention.\n\nAs mentioned above, Apple went to great lengths to gather its own data on facial shapes and angles. And when it did so it made sure to gather them across a broad basis of geographic locations, ages and ethnic backgrounds. Federighi says that Apple has tested it extensively and it should not matter what your cultural background is, Face ID will work with your face.\n\nThere have been plenty of examples of theoretically accessible technology not living up to the actual cultural diversity of our world. A recent example that went viral was a soap dispenser that didn’t recognize a man’s hand because his skin was dark. Apple has gone through some efforts in hardware and software to make sure that this doesn’t happen with Face ID. How it works once it gets out to millions of people we’ll have to wait to see.\n\nAs far as the TrueDepth camera, there are also some side benefits for developers that use ARKit or the depth map to create effects.\n\n“With both the rear-facing cameras and front-facing system [on iPhone X] we expose to developers a depth map, so ARKit will take depth from a photo and create a mesh, but it’s not raw sensor data. It’s depth that can be used for photographic effects,” says Federighi when I ask about other uses for the array. “It’s designed to be very good at close range where the rear-facing cameras are good at greater distances. It’s different technology with a different purpose — as far as selfie range — the probing dot pattern provides a great solution [for a depth map].”\n\nFor those of you who are ARKit developers out there, the system will use a fusion of RGB data with the IR data to give you that mesh. This will allow for enhanced effects and accuracy using the TrueDepth camera array.\n\nThe Face ID story so far\n\nObviously, most people have not had a chance to use Face ID yet and there are a lot more questions. But many of those will likely get answered automatically as people are actually able to put it into practice and start learning the ins and outs of the system.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that there is likely an outsized amount of skepticism about Face ID because other manufacturers like Samsung have shipped versions of facial recognition that are, frankly, crap. If it can be fooled by a simple photo, what the hell are you doing shipping it at all?\n\nFace ID is not a simple image recognition system. It looks at a three-dimensional model of your entire face, recognizing features at a level of detail high enough that Apple is confident that masks will not fool it. It’s a different ballgame entirely.\n\nThe rewards for making security (a passcode) incredibly easy for people to implement and use on a daily basis are enormous. The vast majority of people still use common passwords and don’t enable two-factor authentication on any of their devices. The amount of work that Touch ID has done and Face ID will do to improve the security of regular users is huge.\n\nThis is clearly Apple’s play for the future, and, like Apple commentator John Gruber, I’ve heard that Apple has not intended on including any Touch ID-based authentication in the iPhone X for a very long time.\n\nI’ll probably dissect this further down the line, but there is also massive potential for the Face ID system to bloom into a boom of intent-based computing. If our devices know who we are with authority and constancy, what kinds of interactions are we able to have with them securely and automatically?\n\nContextual computing has been chugging along for quite a while now without a huge breakthrough to allow our devices to become more aware. Face ID just might be opening another enormous door here. But, of course, with any door you have to ask about the consequences of opening it and who holds the keys.\n\nThe potential of iPhone X and Face ID to finally unlock the power of identity-based computing is incredibly exciting. — Matthew Panzarino (@panzer) September 15, 2017\n\nApple’s Face ID processes mirror very closely those they developed for Touch ID. And, even though there are caveats, those have largely stood up to probing from security researchers and nation states alike.\n\nIt’s important to ask the questions and listen carefully to the answers. But so far, the answers seem fairly plain.","author":"Matthew Panzarino","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-15T20:07:26.000Z"},"source":"techcrunch","urlToImage":"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/3q3a0862.jpg","digest":"z2fAzQFiPcgZwVLMBScNJQ==\n"}

The city has suffered multiple terrorist attacks this year.","title":"‘Bucket Bomb’ Strikes London’s Vulnerable Underground","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/world/europe/uk-london-underground-tube-explosion.html","text":"Video\n\nLONDON — Alex Ojeda-Sierra, 13, was on the train to school with a friend when they heard screaming and saw passengers running past.\n\nUnknown to the boys, a bomb had exploded in another car.\n\n“I dropped my bag and we started running,” Alex, who attends the London Oratory School, said from a wheelchair at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where he was treated for facial bruises and sprains when he tripped in the panicky crush of fleeing commuters.\n\n“One man fell on me and I had my legs bent backwards and my right ankle got twisted, and I started screaming that I had no air,” he said.\n\nThe bomb, wrapped in a plastic grocery bag concealed in a bucket, exploded at 8:20 a.m. Friday at the height of the morning rush. The explosion and panic left 29 people injured, but none were killed.\n\nIt was the fifth terrorist attack in Britain this year and the first to hit London at its most vulnerable point — mass transit — since the 2005 bombings that killed 52.\n\nThe Islamic State asserted responsibility for the bucket bomb hours later in a message on its Amaq news site that said a “detachment” of its disciples had carried out the attack — language that suggested more than one assailant.\n\nPhoto\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May, calling the blast a “cowardly attack,” said the national threat level had been raised a notch to “critical,” the highest.\n\nThe bomb exploded just after the train drew into Parsons Green, an elevated station in a quiet and affluent part of West London. It burned at least one passenger, who was carried away on a stretcher, and led to a stampede that injured others.\n\n\n\nThe attack revived the specter of mass casualties from terrorism on the London Underground, commonly known as the Tube, the world’s oldest subway system and one of the busiest. Though one would-be attacker tried to bomb an Underground train last year, the device failed to detonate.\n\nThe most recent attackers in London, and across Europe, have instead used vans and cars as weapons to crush and maim people.\n\nThe head of security on the Underground at the time of the 2005 attacks, Geoff Dunmore, said it was unsurprising that terrorism had returned to the Underground.\n\n“You can do an awful lot to make it safer but you can never totally secure it because of the very nature of it,” said Mr. Dunlop, who left the Underground in 2013 and now works as a private security consultant. “It has to be open.”\n\nWitnesses on the train described a tremor, a wave of heat and then a barrage of flames that quickly dissipated.\n\nPhoto\n\n“The train was packed, and I was down the other side of the carriage standing up, looking at my phone and then I heard a big boom and felt this heat on my face,” said Natalie Belford, 42, a hairdresser and beautician who was on the train. “I ran for my life, but there was no way out. The doors were full of people and the carriage was too packed to move down.”\n\nLondon’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, a face of resolve following the earlier attacks, issued a defiant statement on Facebook that hinted at how terrorist attacks had become a new normal in the capital.\n\n“Our city utterly condemns the hideous individuals who attempt to use terror to harm us and destroy our way of life,” Mr. Khan wrote. “As London has proven again and again, we will never be intimidated or defeated by terrorism.”\n\nThe police were combing through the extensive CCTV footage that blankets all Underground stations, with particular attention to the handful of stations to the west of Parsons Green.\n\nIt was unclear by Friday night whether any possible suspects had been identified from CCTV surveillance.\n\nRoy Ramm, a former commander of specialist operations at Scotland Yard, said the police would be undertaking a comprehensive forensic examination of the train and the device to determine what happened.\n\n“The police will also ask witnesses the age-old question: Did anyone see what happened?” he said. “They will be investigating what the detonation mechanism was and going through CCTV footage to see who might be behind it.”\n\nRecent Terrorist Attacks in London\n\nThe device did not appear to have detonated properly, as the bucket, the bag and a series of wires all remained intact even after the explosion.\n\nMany of the victims seemed to have been hurt by the panicked rush to escape, rather than by the explosion itself. Ms. Belford, the hairdresser, said she was knocked over twice, and showed a reporter her ripped tights and bloodied knee.\n\nWhile Londoners are largely hardened to terrorism and determined to defy the threat, Uber use in West London surged to three times its normal rate after the attack, the company said. But it was unclear whether passengers were turning to the ride service out of fear or practicality; part of the Underground system was suspended after the bombing.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I feel foolish now,” said Rachel Palmer, 34, a mother of two. “I just never imagined it would happen out here.”\n\nTensions were heightened in the neighborhood after the police sealed off several nearby streets and buildings, including Lady Margaret’s school for girls, where students were kept under lockdown for hours.\n\nLife nevertheless continued largely as normal across most other parts of London. While the 2005 attacks led to a shutdown of large parts of the subway network, only a small section close to Parsons Green was suspended on Friday. Large crowds of tourists gathered outside Buckingham Palace, the official residence of the queen, Elizabeth II.\n\nHugh Coyne, a doctor at a medical practice near the station, said he went to the scene to offer help to emergency workers, only to be told there were no major injuries to treat.\n\nThe attack led to tensions between President Trump and the British authorities, who were annoyed that Mr. Trump had appeared to imply in a tweet that the attacker or attackers were known to Scotland Yard, the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, London’s law enforcement agency.\n\nMrs. May said Mr. Trump’s statement was unhelpful, and the Metropolitan Police said it was “pure speculation.”\n\nAfter a terrorist attack in Manchester this summer, American officials angered their British counterparts by leaking information shared with them by the British police.\n\nIn June, Mr. Trump was also entangled in a separate spat with the London mayor, Mr. Khan, in which he criticized Mr. Khan’s response to an attack on London Bridge that left seven dead.","author":"Sewell Chan, Patrick Kingsley and Ceylan Yeginsu","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T16:29:27.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/16/insider/16London4/16London4-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg","digest":"h9Dy7arOsd5sH+saIF4mMQ==\n"}

It was the first spacecraft to orbit the ringed planet.\n\nNorthern Winter\n\nLike Earth, Saturn has a tilted axis. Cassini arrived in the depths of northern winter, with Saturn’s rings tipped up and its north pole in darkness.\n\nA Hexagonal Storm\n\nCassini used infrared to view the hexagonal jet stream swirling around Saturn’s north pole, a six-sided vortex capped with a shimmering aurora.\n\nThe Light Returns\n\nAs spring approached and sunlight returned to Saturn’s north pole, Cassini studied the polar hexagon and the dark hurricane at its center.\n\nApproaching Spring\n\nEach season on Saturn lasts about seven Earth years. Cassini watched as Saturn’s rings slowly tipped downward, casting narrower and narrower shadows.\n\nSaturn’s Spring Equinox\n\nThe shadows grew narrower until the spring equinox, when Saturn’s rings and equator were flat to the sun.\n\nA Yearlong Storm\n\nThe change in seasons brought a huge storm that wrapped around Saturn’s northern hemisphere. Cassini detected lightning deep within the planet.\n\nTitan\n\nMission scientists were particularly interested in Titan, Saturn’s largest moon — a hazy ball larger than the planet Mercury.\n\nCassini’s cameras were able to pierce Titan’s smoggy nitrogen atmosphere, revealing sunlight glinting on frigid lakes of liquid methane and other hydrocarbons.\n\nA radar image of Ligeia Mare, a lake of liquid methane on Titan.\n\nParachuting to Titan\n\nCassini released the Huygens probe to parachute through Titan’s atmosphere. As it descended, the probe recorded rivers and deltas carved by methane rain.\n\nImages taken in four directions as the Huygens probe parachuted through Titan’s atmosphere.\n\nMoon Landing\n\nHuygens sent back the first images from the surface of an alien moon.\n\nGravity Assist\n\nCassini returned to Titan over 100 times, using the large moon’s gravity to gradually shift the spacecraft’s orbit around Saturn.\n\nTitan’s backlit atmosphere.\n\nTitan and Rhea, Saturn’s largest moons.\n\nEarth’s moon is larger than Rhea but smaller than Titan.\n\nAround the Rings\n\nCassini used Titan’s gravity to tour Saturn’s rings, climbing high above the ring plane and threading gaps between the rings.\n\nThe moonlet Atlas, only 19 miles across, follows the sharp edge of Saturn’s A ring.\n\nThe faint D ring, Saturn’s innermost ring.\n\nThe bright and narrow F ring.\n\nThe moon Epimetheus, barely visible at top center, casts a shadow across the A ring.\n\nThe dark Cassini Division separates Saturn’s A and B rings.\n\nA detailed view of the B ring.\n\nRainbows and Starlight\n\nCassini photographed the sun’s reflection and used background stars to measure the opacity of the rings.\n\nA rainbow effect from reflected sunlight.\n\nLight from the star Antares filters through the rings.\n\nSixty-Two Moons\n\nFor 13 years, Cassini joined the intricate dance of Saturn’s 62 moons.\n\nThe moons Rhea and Epimetheus.\n\nClockwise from top: Telesto, Prometheus, Titan and Dione.\n\nGlowing Titan and tiny Janus.\n\nRhea hovers above three distant moons.\n\nFrom left: Dione, Prometheus and Tethys.\n\nFrom left: Tethys, Enceladus and backlit Titan.\n\nEnceladus\n\nBut of all of Saturn’s moons, Enceladus was the most surprising.\n\nEnceladus on the ring plane.\n\nA Hidden Ocean\n\nThe icy crust of Enceladus encases an ocean of water, dotted with hydrothermal vents and warmed by the stretching and squeezing of Saturn’s gravity.\n\nGeysers and Plumes\n\nCassini discovered geysers near the south pole of Enceladus, where plumes of water shoot into space and fall back as bright snow.\n\nGeysers erupting during a Cassini flyby.\n\nInside the Plumes\n\nCassini flew through the plumes many times. The spacecraft’s instruments detected several molecules associated with life, but were not designed to search for microbes.\n\nCould alien microbes be living inside Enceladus? It will take a future mission, and another spacecraft, to find the answer.\n\nSpray from Enceladus forms Saturn’s diffuse E ring.\n\nRhea\n\nRhea, Saturn’s second-largest moon, is nearly 1,000 miles wide and pocked with craters.\n\nIapetus\n\nLike Earth’s moon, Iapetus orbits with the same side facing its planet. The moon’s leading hemisphere sweeps its orbit clean of dark dust, giving Iapetus a two-toned appearance.\n\nDione\n\nCassini flew close by Dione four times, and it discovered evidence of another ocean of water under the moon’s wispy crust of ice.\n\nThe cratered moon Rhea hovers over distant Dione.\n\nWispy terrain on Dione.\n\nTethys\n\nTethys is mostly water ice, marked with a large crater on one side and a canyon running from pole to pole on the other.\n\nTethys appears ghostly white in ultraviolet light.\n\nMimas\n\nMimas is one of the most battered moons in the solar system, bearing dents and dimples from ancient impacts.\n\nHyperion\n\nNot all of Saturn’s moons are round. Hyperion is pockmarked and irregular, and tumbles chaotically in its orbit around the planet.\n\nA Shared Orbit\n\nThe moons Janus and Epimetheus share the same orbit, slipping past each other every four years in an endless relay race.\n\nEpimetheus\n\nJanus\n\nSpiral Waves\n\nWhen Janus and Epimetheus trade places, gravity forms a crest in Saturn’s B ring. Over decades, the crests form a spiral wave, a grooved record of past moon crossings.\n\nWaves in Saturn’s B ring caused by the moon Janus.\n\nBright Spokes\n\nCassini studied the mysterious bright spokes, first seen by the Voyager spacecraft, that appear under the raking light of Saturn’s spring equinox.\n\nFaint spokes crossed by the long shadows of Janus and Mimas.\n\nBudding Moonlets\n\nThe spring light also helped Cassini find small clumps and moonlets casting shadows over the rings.\n\nA tiny moonlet embedded in dense rings.\n\nClearing a Gap\n\nThe flattened moonlet Pan clears a path inside the rings, while Daphnis leaves a rippled wake where it passes.\n\nPan\n\nPan circling within the Encke Gap in Saturn’s A ring.\n\nDaphnis, the “wavemaker” moon.\n\nShepherd Moons\n\nThe moons Prometheus and Pandora straddle the narrow F ring, a thin band that is kinked and braided by the inner moon’s gravity.\n\nPrometheus and Pandora.\n\nKinks and twists in the F ring.\n\nPrometheus carves a new ripple in the F ring.\n\nOverlapping Planes\n\nSome of Cassini’s most striking images were abstract — concentric rings with underlapping shadows.\n\nBanded Saturn\n\nMoons and rings cast crisp shadows across Saturn’s clouds.\n\nFlattened at the Poles\n\nWhen Cassini was level with the rings, Saturn’s oblate shape became clear. The planet is wider than it is tall.\n\nCrescent Saturn with flattened pole.\n\nBacklit by the Sun\n\nSome of Cassini’s orbits took it behind Saturn, into hours of darkness.\n\nOther Worlds Between the Rings\n\nThe spacecraft looked out toward the planet Uranus, a blue speck in the distance.\n\nAnd Cassini turned back to find Earth through a gap in Saturn’s rings.\n\nLast Images\n\nCassini took its final set of images on Thursday. The sequence included a brief glimpse of the moon Enceladus as it slipped behind Saturn.\n\nDive\n\nAfter 22 passes inside the rings, Cassini plowed into Saturn’s rippled clouds on Friday. The spacecraft incinerated itself to prevent any future contamination of the moons Enceladus or Titan.\n\nBurning Into Saturn","author":"Jonathan Corum","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-15T20:32:40.040Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/16/insider/cassini-saturn-images-1505332179034/cassini-saturn-images-1505332179034-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg","digest":"J91avvATru08KvQfjJ20rg==\n"}

It was not clear where Mr. Trump got that information, though 23 minutes earlier, “Fox \u0026 Friends,” a program he regularly watches, broadcast a report in which a security analyst said he feared that the London police had already known the identity of the attackers.\n\n“Can someone tell Scotland Yard?” asked Brian Kilmeade, one of the hosts of the program.\n\nWhite House officials tried to play down the contretemps, saying Mr. Trump was referring to the longstanding efforts of British law enforcement authorities to investigate would-be terrorists, not to anyone involved in Friday’s attack.\n\n“What the president was communicating is that obviously all of our law enforcement efforts are focused on this terrorist threat for years,” said the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster. “Scotland Yard has been a leader, as our F.B.I. has been a leader.”\n\nThe press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said she believed that Mr. Trump’s tweet had come up in the conversation with Mrs. May, though she did not characterize the exchange. Mr. Trump, for his part, referred to Mrs. May as “a wonderful woman.” But Mrs. May made her displeasure clear earlier in the day when she told reporters, “I never think it’s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation.”\n\nOthers were more scathing. Mrs. May’s former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, wrote on Twitter, “True or not — and I’m sure he doesn’t know — this is so unhelpful from leader of our ally and intelligence partner.”\n\nThe president has had a strained relationship with Britain since before he took office. Soon after he was elected, he suggested that Nigel Farage, a leader of Britain’s movement to leave the European Union, should be made the British ambassador to the United States — a decision that, London pointed out, was not Mr. Trump’s to make.\n\nMrs. May and Mr. Trump have had an awkward relationship, going back to their first meeting, when people criticized the way he gripped her hand. Last month, she joined other world leaders in criticizing his response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After a week in which his pursuit of a compromise with Democrats on immigration rattled his supporters, the president appeared eager to seize on a range of red-meat issues to prove his bona fides.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to the travel ban, Mr. Trump said that no agreement protecting undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children could include “chain migration” — shorthand among immigration restrictionists for laws that enable immigrants to petition the government for papers for family members.\n\n“Trump underestimated the reaction of throwing DACA out there for debate, and now he’s telling us he really wanted to use that to get all the things he could get on enforcement,” said Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa and an immigration hard-liner. “I don’t think he realized the base was going to blow up on him.”\n\nMr. Trump even weighed in on the dispute over Jemele Hill, a black female commentator at ESPN, who tweeted that the president was a “white supremacist.” “ESPN is paying a really big price for its politics,” he tweeted. “Apologize for untruth!” Ms. Hill has apologized, but Ms. Sanders said her comment was a “fireable offense.”\n\nSome polls have shown that the president’s political base would mostly support preserving Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which temporarily shields 800,000 young immigrants from deportation. But Mr. King said he was skeptical of those numbers.\n\nNeil Newhouse, a Republican pollster who conducted one of the surveys, said Mr. Trump was engaging in an exercise that he believes has been effective in the past. “He has an ability to hold up a shiny object and his base follows it unerringly, and he’s really good at it,” Mr. Newhouse said.\n\nMr. Trump also does not hesitate to point fingers after suspicious explosions in European cities. Some counterterrorism experts were also asking whether Friday’s explosion was another instance in which the police overseas had mishandled tips about a possible attack. On “Fox \u0026 Friends” shortly before the president tweeted, Jim Hanson, a security analyst who served in the Army Special Forces, said, “My fear, again, is that we’re going to find out this is someone who is known to police.”\n\nA website for the firm Mr. Hanson runs, Security Studies Group, says it focuses on “defending the value of American power against the true threats we face” against a Washington elite that has been “unable or unwilling to address and communicate the most basic requirements of American nationhood.”\n\nMr. Trump also took aim at the Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the attack. He tweeted that his “proactive and nasty” military campaign against the jihadists had made more progress in eight months than the Obama administration had in eight years.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump used characteristically pungent language about the assailants themselves. “Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner,” he tweeted.","author":"Mark Landler and Maggie Haberman","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T22:44:51.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/16/us/16dc-trump1/16dc-trump1-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"sq+YtDRS/v4d+JpgJXyaNA==\n"}

His allies said that despite the humiliation, the attorney general has stayed in the job because he sees a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity as the nation’s top law enforcement official to toughen the country’s immigration policies.\n\nBut he may be losing that battle as well. Mr. Sessions played a prominent role announcing the end of the Obama-era program that provided protection to the children of undocumented immigrants, only to see his boss backtrack on the policy. On Thursday morning, Mr. Trump confirmed he had reached a deal with Democrats to provide protections for the so-called Dreamers.\n\nThis account is based on interviews with seven administration officials and others familiar with the interactions between Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions in recent months who requested anonymity because they are not permitted to speak publicly about confidential conversations between the president and his aides. Politico first reported in July that Mr. Sessions had once offered his resignation letter, but the circumstances that prompted the letter — and Mr. Trump’s dressing down of the attorney general — have not previously been reported.\n\nPress officers for the White House and Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nThe president’s outburst came in the middle of an Oval Office meeting that Mr. Trump had with top advisers on May 17 to discuss candidates to take over the F.B.I. after the president fired its director, James B. Comey, earlier that month. In addition to Mr. Sessions, Vice President Mike Pence; Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel; and several other aides attended the meeting.\n\nIn the middle of the meeting, Mr. McGahn received a phone call from Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who had been overseeing the Russia investigation since Mr. Sessions recused himself from the inquiry months earlier. Mr. Sessions had stepped aside after it was revealed he had not provided accurate testimony to Congress about his meetings with the Russian ambassador during the presidential campaign.\n\nIn the telephone call to Mr. McGahn, Mr. Rosenstein said he had decided to appoint Mr. Mueller to be a special counsel for the investigation. Congress had been putting pressure on Mr. Rosenstein to appoint a special counsel to put distance between the Trump administration and the Russia investigation, and just the day before The New York Times had revealed that Mr. Trump had once asked Mr. Comey to end the F.B.I.’s investigation into Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser.\n\nWhen the phone call ended, Mr. McGahn relayed the news to the president and his aides. Almost immediately, Mr. Trump lobbed a volley of insults at Mr. Sessions, telling the attorney general it was his fault they were in the current situation. Mr. Trump told Mr. Sessions that choosing him to be attorney general was one of the worst decisions he had made, called him an “idiot,” and said that he should resign.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAn emotional Mr. Sessions told the president he would resign and left the Oval Office. That evening, as the Justice Department publicly announced the appointment of Mr. Mueller, the attorney general wrote a brief resignation letter to the president that was later sent to the White House. A person familiar with the events raised the possibility that Mr. Sessions had become emotional because the impact of his recusal was becoming clear.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Bannon, the president’s chief strategist at the time; and Reince Priebus, his chief of staff, all advised that accepting Mr. Sessions’s resignation would only sow more chaos inside the administration and rally Republicans in Congress against the president. Mr. Sessions, a former Alabama senator, served in the Senate for two decades.\n\nThe president relented, and eventually returned the resignation letter to Mr. Sessions — with a handwritten response on it.\n\nFor Mr. Sessions, the aggressiveness with which Mr. Trump has sought his removal was a blow. The son of a general store owner in a small town in Alabama, Mr. Sessions had long wanted to be the nation’s top federal law enforcement official or to serve in another top law enforcement or judicial post. He earned a reputation in the Senate as someone tough on immigration, and was the first senator to back Mr. Trump in the presidential campaign.\n\nBut their relationship began to deteriorate little more than a month after Mr. Trump was sworn in as president, after Mr. Sessions’s announcement that he was recusing himself from the Russia inquiry caught Mr. Trump by surprise.\n\nThe president spent months stewing about the recusal. In a July 19 interview with The Times, Mr. Trump said he never would have appointed Mr. Sessions to be attorney general if he knew he was going to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Mr. Trump called the decision “very unfair to the president.”\n\nDays after the Times interview, Mr. Trump told aides he wanted to replace Mr. Sessions. Some of the president’s aides, not sure if Mr. Trump really wanted the attorney general gone or was just working through his anger, were able to delay the firing until the president’s anger passed.\n\nBut Mr. Trump continued his public attacks in the days that followed, including taking to Twitter to call him “weak” — a word that is among the harshest criticisms in Mr. Trump’s arsenal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdministration officials and some of Mr. Trump’s outside advisers have puzzled at Mr. Sessions’s decision to stay on. But people close to Mr. Sessions said that he did not leave because he had a chance to have an impact on what he sees as a defining issue of his career: curtailing legal and illegal immigration.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has spearheaded the effort to undo what he believed to be the Obama administration’s dangerously lenient immigration policies, including the Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nMr. Sessions had no illusions about converting Mr. Trump to his side of the argument — Mr. Trump remains deeply ambivalent — and he had no illusions about repairing a damaged relationship he had once regarded as a friendship. But he told people he felt he had successfully pushed the president toward ending the Obama immigration policy, and thought it had given him increased leverage in the West Wing.\n\nThe president agreed to terminate the program, and on Sept. 5 Mr. Sessions stood alone at a lectern — a moment that seemed to be a significant victory for the attorney general.\n\nBut his satisfaction was fleeting. Mr. Trump quickly undercut Mr. Sessions in a tweet by saying he would reconsider whether or not to end the program, leading the attorney general to tell allies that he was frustrated that the president had muddled months of work leading to the announcement of the new policy.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Democrats announced they had reached a deal with the president to quickly extend protections for young undocumented immigrants.\n\nOn Thursday morning, taking a vastly different position from the one Mr. Sessions had announced, the president tweeted about the need for protections for people brought here “through no fault of their own.”","author":"Michael S.

On Friday, North Korea threatened to “sink” Japanese islands with nuclear weapons, adding that “Japan is no longer needed to exist near us.”\n\nJapan’s position east of North Korea also means that missiles fired by the North toward the United States, including Guam, almost certainly would have to fly over Japanese territory.\n\nBut the missile defense systems stationed across Japan on mobile launchers are designed only to intercept missiles as they are descending, not in midflight as they are headed to the United States. Other defense systems on four naval destroyers can target missiles midflight, but they have to be in the right place at the right time.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt is also unclear whether the pacifist Constitution allows Japan to shoot down a missile headed for the United States, much less initiate a pre-emptive attack on a missile on a launchpad in North Korea, as some in Japan believe it should be prepared to do.\n\nIn recent months, the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has revived a long-simmering discussion over whether to acquire cruise missiles — which can be fired from land, air or sea — that would allow it to strike a launch site in North Korea if it detected signs of an imminent attack.\n\nThe Japanese government ruled in 1956 that such a pre-emptive strike fell under its right of self-defense, but some lawmakers say deploying cruise missiles could cross a line and break with longstanding policy established after World War II to eschew offensive weapons. While the Japanese public is anxious about North Korea, it is torn about developing the nation’s military capabilities.\n\n“The Japanese public is still not so sure about this,” said Richard Samuels, a Japan specialist and the director of the Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPresident Trump signaled this month that he wanted Japan, along with South Korea, to bolster arms spending. In a Twitter post two days after North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test, Mr. Trump said he would allow the two countries to “buy a substantially increased amount of highly sophisticated military equipment from the United States.”\n\nIt is unclear whether Mr. Trump had specific equipment in mind, or whether that included cruise missiles.\n\nIn Japan, part of the political calculation is how China or South Korea might react to such a purchase. “It will be an excuse to China for further military buildup,” said Koji Murata, a professor of international relations at Doshisha University in Kyoto. “And even in South Korea, some kind of anti-Japanese sentiment will be further facilitated.”\n\nItsunori Onodera, Japan’s defense minister, has avoided discussing a pre-emptive strike on North Korea. Instead, he speaks of counterstrikes, suggesting a more passive interpretation of the country’s legal rights under the Constitution.\n\n“In Japan’s case, I don’t think we can shoot before we are shot,” said Noboru Yamaguchi, a professor of international relations at the International University of Japan in Niigata and a retired lieutenant general in Japan’s army, known as the Ground Self-Defense Force. “Most likely, once we are shot and the second or third missiles are coming and they are on the ground, we can shoot back.”\n\nVideo\n\nSome analysts say that officials in Mr. Abe’s administration have been careful to use language that will not alarm the public. In polls, about half those surveyed say they would oppose Japan’s acquiring missiles to be used in pre-emptive strikes.\n\nBut as North Korea steps up missile launches and nuclear tests, Mr. Abe and his cabinet can make a stronger argument for such missiles. “They can say, ‘Look at what North Korea is doing. Yes, we have to protect ourselves,’” said Jeffrey W. Hornung, a political scientist at the RAND Corporation.\n\nAn upgrade of the country’s ballistic missile defenses would be a much easier sell politically.\n\nTo best protect itself from a missile attack, some experts say, Japan should buy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or Thaad, which intercepts enemy rockets at higher altitudes than its current land-based systems.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That response has given some in Japan pause.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead, Japan has said it plans to equip and deploy more destroyers with the Aegis missile defense system. The Defense Ministry has also indicated it wants to acquire a land-based system, known as Aegis Ashore, which can intercept missiles above the atmosphere and above Thaad’s range.\n\nStill, most experts say that missile defense is hardly foolproof.\n\n“Missile defense is still limited and very expensive, so you have to be somewhat lucky at this point,” said Patrick M. Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. “To have the political will to fire, you are taking a big gamble. Because if you miss, how does that look?”\n\nNorth Korea has stated its clear intention to develop nuclear weapons capable of hitting the mainland United States and has threatened to strike the waters near Guam in the western Pacific with an “enveloping fire.”\n\nTwo years ago, Mr. Abe helped push through security legislation that authorized overseas combat missions by the Japanese military alongside allied troops in the name of “collective self-defense.”\n\nFor Japan to participate in such collective action, the new laws say, its own security must also be under threat. Some analysts question whether, under that definition, lawmakers would authorize an effort to shoot down missiles en route to the United States.\n\nPhoto\n\n“Japan’s security and legal restrictions are absurdly complex,” said Tsuneo Watanabe, a senior research fellow at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation in Tokyo.\n\nOthers contend that an attack on Japan’s most important ally surely should be interpreted as a threat to Japan itself, given that the United States is essentially Japan’s protector.\n\n“If Japan sees U.S. bases almost being hit, that may be regarded as a situation where, if we don’t save them, Japan’s existence is in danger,” said Professor Yamaguchi of the International University of Japan. “In such a case we could legally engage.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough the Defense Ministry recently increased its annual budget request to a record high of 5.26 trillion yen, or about $48 billion, its military spending relative to gross domestic product is minimal compared with those of other countries. And Japan may have other military equipment on its wish list, including amphibious vehicles or more fighter jets.\n\n“If the resources are limited, we have to prioritize,” Professor Yamaguchi said.\n\n“North Korea is not the only problem. We have to deal with global terrorism, and we need to deal constructively with China,” he added, referring to Beijing’s territorial incursions in the East and South China Seas.\n\nLooming in the background is the question of whether Japan should develop nuclear weapons to counteract North Korea’s threat.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign last year, Mr. Trump suggested Japan might be “better off” with its own nuclear arsenal. But public opinion in Japan is firmly against it.\n\nThe White House now opposes Japan — and others in Asia — acquiring nuclear weapons, a senior administration official said, but it has also warned China and Russia that such proliferation may be inevitable if North Korea does not abandon its program.\n\nKen Jimbo, an associate professor of policy management at Keio University in Tokyo, noted Japan’s status as the only country to have ever suffered nuclear attacks, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States.\n\n“So our own nuclear option will be our last resort, always,” he said.","author":"Motoko Rich","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T04:55:09.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/14/world/14japan-military-1/14japan-military-1-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"5xgwoaEhqXonE2ajushL8w==\n"}

He played Molly Ringwald’s underemployed father in the teenage romance “Pretty in Pink” (1986), the apostle Paul in Martin Scorsese’s “The Last Temptation of Christ” (1988), a private eye in David Lynch’s “Wild at Heart” (1990), a judge in Terry Gilliam’s “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” (1998), the hero’s ailing brother in Mr. Lynch’s “The Straight Story” (1999), a veteran inmate cheerfully testing the electrocution equipment in “The Green Mile” (1999) and Charlie Sheen’s father in “The Big Bounce” (2004).\n\nMr. Stanton was cast in one of his best-known roles when he was almost 80: that of Roman Grant, a self-proclaimed prophet with 14 wives, on “Big Love,” HBO’s acclaimed series about the everyday lives of polygamists. After his character was killed in the Season 3 finale in 2009, he joked that the show had generated more response than anything else he had done, “except for a couple hundred other movies.”\n\nMr. Stanton had an impressive singing voice and toured with a male chorus early in his career. He first sang on screen in “Cool Hand Luke” (1967), doing three numbers, including the hymn “Just a Closer Walk With Thee.” He later formed the Harry Dean Stanton Band, which played rock, blues, jazz and Tex-Mex numbers in Los Angeles nightclubs and on tour.\n\nIn 2014 he released an album, “Harry Dean Stanton: Partly Fiction,” consisting of songs he sang on the soundtrack of a documentary about him by the same name.\n\nPhoto\n\nHarry Dean Stanton was born in West Irvine, Ky., a small town southeast of Lexington, on July 14, 1926, the son of Sheridan Stanton, a tobacco farmer who also worked as a barber, and the former Ersel Moberly, a cook.\n\nAfter serving in the Navy in the Pacific during World War II, he attended the University of Kentucky, where he became interested in drama. Dropping out of college after three years, he moved to Los Angeles and studied acting at the Pasadena Playhouse.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Stanton — who was often billed as Dean Stanton early in his career to avoid confusion with another character actor, Harry Stanton — made his first television appearance in 1954 in an episode of “Inner Sanctum,” a syndicated mystery and suspense anthology series. His film debut was in “Tomahawk Trail,” a 1957 western starring Chuck Connors, and for the first two decades of his career westerns were his specialty.\n\nAmong the numerous TV westerns on which he was seen were “Rawhide,” “Bonanza” and “The Big Valley.” He was also on eight episodes of “Gunsmoke,” playing a different character in each. His last western film was Arthur Penn’s unorthodox “The Missouri Breaks” (1976), starring Marlon Brando and Mr. Stanton’s onetime roommate Jack Nicholson.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Stanton remained busy to the end. He had small roles in the 2012 movies “The Avengers” and “Seven Psychopaths” and was in episodes of the HBO series “Getting On” in 2013 and 2014.

Two men were captured in a police chase and sentenced to prison.\n\nThere was no immediate information on his survivors.\n\nEven as his profile rose, Mr. Stanton expressed some disappointment in his career. “It’s just so frustrating when you’re in a supporting role because you only get to express a part of yourself,” he said in a 1986 interview with The Los Angeles Times.\n\nBut he was matter-of-fact about his gift.

If you’re feeling this deprived during your courtship, just imagine what happens when you move in and have kids. The broader issue here has to do with feeling loved. For you, this involves the chance to express your sexual desire for your partner. She doesn’t share the same intensity of desire. This inequality isn’t anyone’s fault. But it is your circumstance, and it poses a real threat to your happiness. Given that you’ve already talked a good deal on your own, with little discernible improvement, I’d suggest talking with a counselor before you move in together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCS: Talking more explicitly about this issue will not only communicate to your partner how important sex is to you, it will also give you an opportunity to understand her sexuality better. I don’t see it as a contradiction that her attraction for you doesn’t always translate into desire. I think it’s fairly common in long-term relationships — which is among the reasons the frequency of sex so often drops off over time. It can be difficult to get things rolling once the great driving engine of lust subsides. So it’s time to have a conversation that goes beyond your bedroom talks about turn-ons and fantasies, Frustrated. What does compel your girlfriend to want to have sex with you and how might the two of you create those conditions more often? Are there ways other than sex that you might nurture and sustain your erotic connection with each other?\n\nSA: I’m curious how your partner reacts to your attempts to initiate intimacy. Even if she doesn’t want to make love, is she able to acknowledge and engage with your desire in other ways? Are you open to soliciting other forms of erotic connection? I ask because I sense that you yearn for a lover who feels desire for you, not just one who consents to having sex when you initiate. I think it’s great to seek compromise, and to get creative in finding ways to reconcile the imbalance in your libidos. But to do so, you have to be radically honest about the true nature of your desires in a lover.\n\nCS: Steve is right that so much of this is about the murkier territory of intimacy and desire — all of that is worth examining. And yet there’s also a very practical way through this. Perhaps, Frustrated, you simply need to ask your girlfriend if she’d be willing to jump in the sack with you once a week so you feel more content in your relationship. I know this sounds incredibly unsexy, but I’m a fan of appointment sex. It doesn’t rely upon magic to make it happen. It’s on your to-do list. (Which doesn’t mean that magic won’t be made.) Like so many worthwhile things in my life — writing, exercising — I’m not always in the mood to have sex, but afterward I’m always glad I did. It’s the just-do-it model of doing it. And it works.\n\nSA: Love appointment sex! Cheryl’s plan is definitely worth a try. But if it doesn’t work, I want to reiterate my suggestion that you visit a counselor, preferably a sex therapist who can help you explore what erotic intimacy means for each of you, and for your relationship. Look, I don’t know anyone in a long-term monogamy who feels completely satisfied and in sync with their partner sexually. But I do know that it’s not fair for one person to walk around feeling sexually deprived and undesired. Nor for that person’s partner to feel pressured and resented. We all have different libidos, different yearnings, a different erotic imagination. What matters in the end is that the person we choose to be with accepts and even embraces our sexuality. The two of you may disagree about what constitutes a “robust, healthy sex life,” Frustrated. But you both have to be willing to acknowledge this as a goal. If your partner can’t, your next step may be finding a partner who can.","author":"Steve Almond and Cheryl Strayed","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-14T04:00:49.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/14/fashion/14SWEETSPOT/14SWEETSPOT-facebookJumbo.gif","digest":"QdTlVo+JqGwnoUS9vTxU7w==\n"}

Drew Faust, a historian who is departing as Harvard’s president in June after a decade, has expanded global outreach and financial aid, and hired a host of minority faculty who have broadened perspectives about prison reform and black culture.\n\nIn that mode of outreach, staff members of both Harvard’s history and American studies departments took it upon themselves to type Ms. Jones’s application into Harvard’s online system since she could not.\n\nBut after the history department accepted her and the American studies program listed her as a top alternate, two American studies professors flagged Ms. Jones’s file for the admissions dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. In a memo to university administrators, these professors said the admissions dean had told them Ms. Jones’s selection would be reviewed by the president and provost, and questioned whether she had minimized her crime “to the point of misrepresentation.”\n\nPhoto\n\n“We didn’t have some preconceived idea about crucifying Michelle,” said John Stauffer, one of the two American studies professors. “But frankly, we knew that anyone could just punch her crime into Google, and Fox News would probably say that P.C. liberal Harvard gave 200 grand of funding to a child murderer, who also happened to be a minority. I mean, c’mon.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Jones got pregnant at 14 after what she called non-consensual sex with a high-school senior. Her mother responded by beating her in the stomach with a board, according to the prosecutor who later handled her case, and she was placed in a series of group homes and foster families.\n\nIn a personal statement accompanying her Harvard application, Ms. Jones said she had a psychological breakdown after years of abandonment and domestic violence, and inflicted similar treatment on her own son, Brandon Sims.\n\nThe boy died in 1992 in circumstances that remain unclear; the body was never found.\n\nTwo years later, during a stay at a mental-health crisis center, Ms. Jones admitted that she had buried him without notifying the police or Brandon’s father and his family. At her trial, a former friend testified that Ms. Jones confessed to having beaten the boy and then leaving him alone for days in their apartment, eventually returning to find him dead in his bedroom.\n\nMs. Jones was sentenced to 50 years in prison, but was released after 20 based on her good behavior and educational attainment.\n\nIn her statement to Harvard, Ms. Jones wrote of Brandon: “I have made a commitment to myself and him that with the time I have left, I will live a redeemed life, one of service and value to others.”\n\nBrandon’s father and grandmother could not be reached for comment.\n\nWhere Were the Ladies?\n\nIncarcerated in 1996, Ms. Jones worked for five years in the law library at Indiana Women’s Prison, and got certified as a paralegal. She received a bachelor’s degree from Ball State University in 2004, and audited graduate-level classes at Indiana University.\n\nHer blossoming as a historian began in 2012, when Kelsey Kauffman, a former professor who volunteered at the prison, encouraged inmates to research the origins of their involuntary home, which opened in 1873 as the first adult female correctional facility in the United States. Soon, Ms. Jones was placing library requests for reference books and, when they arrived months later, scouring the footnotes for what to order next.\n\nAfter meticulously logging demographic data from century-old registries from the Indiana Women’s Prison, Ms. Jones made a discovery: There were no prostitutes on the rolls. “Where,” she asked, “were all the ladies?” meaning so-called ladies of the night.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith the help of a state librarian, she and another inmate realized that a Catholic laundry house that opened around that time in Indianapolis was actually a reformatory for “fallen women” — those convicted of sex offenses. Then they found more than 30 similar institutions around the country, akin to the Magdalene Laundries recently unearthed in Ireland.\n\nUnder Ms. Kauffman’s tutelage, they wrote up their findings, published them in an Indiana academic journal, and won the state historical society award. Ms. Jones also presented the paper remotely at multiple academic conferences, and, at others, shared different work about the abuse of early inmates at Indiana Women’s Prison by its Quaker founders.\n\nMs. Jones was supposed to be released in October, but received a two-month reduction of her sentence so she could start a Ph.D. program on time this fall. She applied to eight, with Harvard her first choice because of historians there whose work on incarceration she admired.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

A “ban the box” campaign by civil-rights groups led scores of institutions, including Harvard’s graduate schools, to remove a question about criminal records from their initial applications.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut most of these efforts focus on giving a fresh start to nonviolent offenders, especially those caught up by tough sentencing laws for drug crimes.\n\n“It’s like we only have enough imagination — and courage — to envision second chances for the people who shouldn’t have been in prison in the first place,” Professor Johnson said.\n\nMs. Jones’s many supporters include Heather Ann Thompson, who won the Pulitzer Prize in history this spring, and submitted a recommendation letter on her behalf. There is also Diane Marger Moore, the prosecutor who argued that Ms. Jones receive the maximum sentence two decades ago and is now writing a book about the case.\n\n“Look, as a mother, I thought it was just an awful crime,” said Ms. Marger Moore, now a lawyer at a large firm in Los Angeles. “But what Harvard did is highly inappropriate: I’m the prosecutor, not them. Michelle Jones served her time, and she served a long time, exactly what she deserved. A sentence is a sentence.”\n\nHer backers saw her background as an asset, given the growing academic interest in incarceration.\n\n“It was a chance for us to do something that we’ve been saying we’re trying to do at Harvard, which is to set up conversations between academics and eyewitnesses,” said Walter Johnson, director of an American history study center at the university.\n\nBut the American studies professors said in their memo to administrators that “honest and full narration is an essential part of our enterprise,” and questioned whether Ms. Jones had met that standard in framing her past. In the personal statement, which was not required, she did not detail her involvement in the crime, but wrote that as a teenager she left Brandon at home alone, that he died, and that she has grieved for him deeply and daily since.\n\nProfessor Stauffer emphasized in interviews that he and his departmental colleague, Dan Carpenter, were simply trying to ensure that Harvard did its due diligence about the candidacy.\n\nPhoto\n\n“We do not want to stand in the way of, advance a case against, or in any way hijack the career of Michelle Jones, who has served her time, who has clearly done amazing things while incarcerated, who shows passion for her craft, and whose full story the two of us can never really know,” they wrote in the memo.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“If officials who take a careful look at the case decide that Harvard should move forward, then we think that the university should do everything in its power and ability to welcome Ms. Jones here and support her, and we are indeed happy to play a part in that effort,” they continued. “We have stated our concerns as questions, and we hope they are treated as nothing more nor less than questions, not as an implicit or explicit judgment against a person and her candidacy.”\n\nMs. Jones, in an interview, said that if anyone at Harvard wanted her to elaborate on the criminal case or her preparedness for the Ph.D. program, they should have asked. “I just didn’t want my crime to be the lens through which everything I’d done, and hoped for, was seen,” she said.\n\n“I knew that I had come from this very dark place — I was abhorrent to society,” she continued. “But for 20 years, I’ve tried to do right, because I was still interested in the world, and because I didn’t believe my past made me somehow cosmically un-educatable forever.”\n\nThe Toughest School\n\nYale University also rejected Ms. Jones, though it is unclear what role her crime may have played in its decision; officials would not discuss her application.\n\nBut she was courted by the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Michigan; the University of Kansas; and N.Y.U., which assigned graduate students to send Ms. Jones welcoming notes on JPay, a prison email app.\n\nShe arrived in Manhattan during the back-to-school season of fresh starts, having never used a smartphone. She wore prison-issue glasses and carried boxes full of jailhouse research notes.\n\nIf her new parole officer allows it, Ms. Jones hopes to teach in N.Y.U.’s prison education program, as a way to remember where she has been. She also hopes to take the train to Cambridge, Mass., every other week to sit in on a Harvard seminar on the history of crime and punishment in America.\n\n“We’re having her come up here for that partly out of a sense of pique,” Mr. Johnson said.\n\nAt N.Y.U., Nikhil Singh, faculty director of the prison-education program, acknowledged that “Michelle will have a lot to prove.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Our hope is that she is actually far, far more resourceful and driven than most college students,” he added, “who take for granted they are supposed to be here.”\n\nOn the Friday before classes started, in a lounge on the N.Y.U. campus, Ms. Jones said any presumption that she is not ready for a Ph.D. underestimates her own moxie and “sells prison short.”\n\n“People don’t survive 20 years of incarceration with any kind of grace unless they have the discipline to do their reading and writing in the chaos of that place,” Ms. Jones said. “Forget Harvard. I’ve already graduated from the toughest school there is.”","author":"Eli Hager","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-15T20:46:13.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/15/insider/14noharvard1/00noharvard-1-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"XU5RSVDcj4+6uJWr+5mDFA==\n"}

(Reuters)\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said on Sept. 14 that she trusts President Trump in working on a replacement for DACA. (Reuters)\n\nDemocratic lawmakers shut out of governance for much of this year now find themselves at the center of high-stakes negotiations with President Trump that could achieve a prize they have sought for nearly a decade: permanent legal status for hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants.\n\nFor a small but vocal contingent of Democrats, these talks are fraught with peril, largely because of their total distrust of a man who began his presidential campaign two years ago describing illegal immigrants from Mexico as rapists.\n\nBut for Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), there is little to lose. If the deal falls apart and Trump returns to his pattern of insult-hurling and name-calling, the Democratic leaders will be right where they began — no better and no worse. And a successful negotiation would achieve something they failed to pull off when their party controlled both Congress and the White House. It could also serve as a road map for more achievements to come.\n\n“Nothing ventured, nothing gained,” Schumer said in an interview. “We thought we had an opportunity to get something good done, and let’s see what happens. We’re very hopeful that they will keep their word.”\n\nSchumer and Pelosi are pressing ahead with the president’s top advisers, hoping to reach a deal in a matter of weeks to enshrine in law an Obama-era executive order called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. It protects from deportation undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. Trump has criticized DACA as executive overreach, but he has also expressed empathy for the young immigrants it protects.\n\nPresident Trump meets with congressional leaders in the Oval Office on Sept. 6, 2017. From left are Vice President Pence, Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Minority Leader Charles E.Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nThere is one critical stumbling block to the whole effort to pass a Dream Act to replace DACA: how much additional border security and enforcement Trump will demand.\n\nThe deep fear among Democrats skeptical of the negotiations is that, in exchange for permanent protections for “dreamers,” Trump will win broad new powers and resources to enforce immigration laws that go beyond adding more agents or technology along the border. The cost of a permanent Dream Act, they say, could be a new and emboldened deportation force across the nation that undermines civil liberties and terrorizes law-abiding immigrants.\n\n“We’re going to have to be very leery and very careful of the slippery slope,” said Rep. Luis V. Gutiérrez (D-Ill.).\n\n“There is no fresh start with Trump, and I don’t trust him,” said Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.).\n\nWashington heads are still spinning from a negotiating dynamic that no one expected — not Schumer and Pelosi, and not their Republican counterparts, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nTrump spent his first seven months in an entirely partisan bubble, working only with Republicans trying, and failing, to pass conservative legislation — notably a replacement to the Affordable Care Act. And it was less than a month ago when Pelosi said Trump should be formally censured by Congress for how he responded to the violence surrounding the white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville.\n\nBut Trump’s frustration with GOP leaders reached a boiling point during the failed effort to repeal former president Barack Obama’s signature health-care law, losing in the Senate by one vote when three Republicans opposed Trump. From the White House’s perspective, that frustration — and Trump’s pivot to working with Democrats — is justified.\n\nOn Sept. 7, a day after striking a debt ceiling and Harvey aid deal with President Trump, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) lauded Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) for his role in the discussion. (Reuters)\n\n“Republicans have shown they can’t keep 50 out of 52 members in line, even after six years of promise to repeal and replace Obamacare when given the opportunity,” said Marc Short, Trump’s director of legislative affairs.\n\nCongressional Republicans, for their part, worry that Pelosi and Schumer could outsmart Trump. The two are seasoned dealmakers with combined service of more than 65 years on Capitol Hill, while Trump is a newcomer who honed his negotiating skills in real estate. Republicans have noted in particular how Trump and Schumer — one raised in Queens, the other in Brooklyn — are bonding over their outer-borough roots, leaving the president, they fear, vulnerable to getting the short end of the deal.\n\nTrump’s closest advisers are enjoying the theater of how quickly allegiances are ebbing and flowing from week to week. “Washington will never keep pace with Trump speed,” Kellyanne Conway, counselor to Trump, said in an interview. “A non-politician’s measure of progress is fundamentally different than that of Washington. It’s grounded in business, it’s grounded in results, it’s grounded in performance.”\n\nOne senior White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to comment on internal discussions, said Trump sees Schumer as an exciting and energetic contrast to McConnell, whose default posture is intense silence. Trump sees McConnell’s deep knowledge of pulling levers of powers as a perfectly fine skill but one that is at odds with Trump’s stated goal of disrupting the traditional, establishment-driven ways of Washington.\n\nTrump and Democrats strike DACA deal. Yes? No? Sort of? Trump’s world can be confusing.\n\nThe majority of rank-and-file Democrats, as well as liberal activists around the nation, are willing to give Schumer and Pelosi room to maneuver. Progressive organizers, who had scorched Democrats for voting to confirm Trump’s Cabinet nominees, have generally held their fire so far on the bipartisan DACA talks eight months after some of them had surrounded Schumer’s Brooklyn home chanting, “Chuck’s a chicken.”\n\n“They’re in this position because there’s been a whole national movement, years in the making, on behalf of the dreamers,” said Héctor Figueroa, a New York labor organizer who is co-chairman of the progressive Working Families Party.\n\nFor now, Schumer and Pelosi have taken a page from Ronald Reagan’s old “trust but verify” adage toward the Soviets. They say that they have convinced Trump that protecting immigrants currently covered by DACA is the right policy and the right political move for a president with poor approval ratings.\n\n“Look, he said he would do this,” Schumer said. “I take him at his word that he will.”\n\nPelosi at first deflected a question about whether she trusts Trump.\n\n“Is that a fair question?” she asked reporters last week, before finally saying that, on this issue, she does, indeed, trust him. “I believe that the president, [not only] because of conviction, but because of reality, is there for the dreamers.”\n\nCritical challenges ahead could hobble the emerging deal. One is the uncertainty surrounding an erratic president, whose engagement with Democrats — on immigration, and a week earlier on short-term fiscal policy and hurricane relief — was not expected and not part of a grand plan.\n\n“I’m not sure there is a broader strategy,” said Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.), a lieutenant in Pelosi’s leadership team. “I don’t think we should be surprised if he comes back next week, and he’s working with Republicans only. It’s a case-by-case basis.”\n\nRegarding the scope of border-security measures, Schumer said he signaled support for four points of toughened security: electronic surveillance at the Mexican border, detection devices focused on drug smugglers, improved infrastructure along the border and more search helicopters.\n\nBut Ryan, trying to reassert the power of congressional Republicans, added something to the talks. “We need border security and enforcement as part of any agreement,” he said Thursday, the morning after Trump’s White House huddle with the two Democrats.\n\nThe “enforcement” portion of his remarks set off alarm bells in the Hispanic caucus. “Where is it going to lead, once the alt-right starts raising their voices, which they’ve already begun and will only become louder?” asked Gutiérrez, referring to the white nationalist movement that has supported Trump and loudly advocated for tougher immigration enforcement.\n\nThese Democrats, for instance, will not support a deal to add thousands of agents nationwide to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, a step they forecast would lead in turn to a surge in deportations.\n\nAnother potential dealbreaker is the question of whether dreamers would be given a path to citizenship or merely permanent legal status. Pelosi and Schumer said they were specific with Trump in explaining that he would support the Dream Act introduced by Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Richard J.

John McCain (R-Ariz.), a military hawk and one of the GOP’s most outspoken critics of Trump, said in a statement Friday that he was backing the measure because “we should welcome all those who are willing and able to serve our country.”\n\n“Any member of the military who meets the medical and readiness standards should be allowed to serve — including those who are transgender,” he continued.\n\nThe announcement from McCain came as he joined Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, and committee members Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) in introducing a bill to thwart the president’s plan.\n\nMcCain had previously been cagey about whether he would support the Gillibrand-Collins effort, noting that it might be premature, because the ban had not gone into effect. He did, however, promise to let senators offer any amendments they wanted.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Aug. 29 current policy regarding transgender personnel serving in the military would remain in place until he advises President Donald Trump on how to implement his directive on a transgender ban. (Reuters)\n\nTrump announced via Twitter in July that transgender troops would no longer be allowed to serve in the military. And last month, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced he would conduct a six-month review of transgender troops before implementing that order. For now, transgender troops currently in the military are being allowed to reenlist, according to new Pentagon guidelines reported Friday by the Associated Press.\n\nUnder Trump’s plan, Mattis has until Feb. 1 to finish his study. But the Senate’s bill would speed up Mattis’s timeline to the end of the year, prevent the military from discharging currently-serving transgender troops, and express Congress’ conviction that qualified individuals should be allowed to serve regardless of gender identity.\n\nDespite McCain’s and Reed’s support, it is not clear whether the bill will get a full Senate vote in the next several months.\n\nGillibrand and Collins had hoped to attach an amendment to that National Defense Authorization Act pushing back against the transgender troops ban. But their efforts fell short when the Senate could not agree on a roster of amendments to vote on, so they redrafted the amendment as a separate piece of legislation.\n\nThe defense appropriations bill is one of the few so-called “must-pass” measures that Congress grapples with each year, and thus is a popular vehicle for lawmakers who might otherwise have difficulty securing debate time for their preferred measures. In the next several months, Congress must tackle budget matters, a looming debt ceiling, immigration and several other high-profile issues that could eclipse a bill to ensure the military service of transgender troops.\n\nStill, McCain’s endorsement puts some urgency behind the matter, and it signals to both congressional leaders and Mattis that this is not an issue he intends to ignore.\n\n“The Senate Armed Services Committee will review the results of the DOD study on accession,” McCain said in his statement, “and will continue to work closely with our military leaders on any policy changes as we conduct oversight on this important issue.”\n\nPresident Trump spoke about banning transgender people from the military in Bedminster N.J. on Aug. 10.

From left, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas). (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nAs long as there has been a federal income tax, taxpayers have been able to deduct most of the state and local taxes they pay from earnings subject to Uncle Sam’s grasp. But that deduction — especially popular in states rich in Democratic voters — could disappear as soon as next year if President Trump and congressional Republicans succeed in their promised rewrite of the tax code.\n\nThe state and local tax deduction, or SALT, has long been a target for tax-policy wonks who see it as an unwise federal subsidy that is mainly claimed by the wealthy. But politics have always intervened: Thanks to the opposition of lawmakers in high-tax states, the deduction has survived every effort to clear out loopholes, including the last federal tax overhaul of similar ambition in 1986.\n\nNow, Republican leaders have made clear the SALT deduction is on the table, and it has shaken up a number of blue-state GOP legislators who are warning that it could derail the ambitious tax plan Trump is now pushing.\n\n[Trump’s push for tax cuts is coming up against a familiar challenge: Divided GOP]\n\n“I intend to fight it with everything I know how,” said Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), who represents a district where 43 percent of tax filers claim SALT deductions and signed a bipartisan letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urging him to preserve the break. “It’s a big deal for states like ours.”\n\nThe incentives to eliminate, or at least chip away, at the deduction could be impossible for congressional tax writers to ignore. Republicans are hoping to drive down both individual and corporate tax rates using special congressional procedures that will require their plan to not increase the deficit in the long term. Doing so means offsetting the costs of rate cuts by closing loopholes, and few of them yield more revenue than the SALT deduction.\n\nLast year, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated the deduction’s cost to the Treasury at more than $368 billion through 2020, and the Congressional Budget Office reported that simply capping the deduction would cut deficits by $955 billion over a decade.\n\nThe other individual tax provisions whose elimination could generate close to that revenue are even more politically sacred — including the favored treatment for retirement savings, employer-paid health-care premiums, investment income and mortgage interest.\n\n“It’s really hard to envision tax reform that’s worth writing home about, that’s done revenue-neutrally, without including this,” said Ryan Ellis, a conservative tax lobbyist. “It’s very, very difficult to envision how you would piece it together. We’ve taken so many hits on everything else.”\n\nThat is a reference to the demise of other potential “pay-fors” to offset the GOP’s rate cuts, including a “border adjustment” tax on corporate expenses. That proposal, favored by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), might have raised a trillion dollars over 10 years but generated fierce opposition from some businesses.\n\n[Trump’s fickleness frightens his base — and could doom tax reform]\n\nNow Ryan, who is eyeing the SALT deduction, has made the conservative policy case for eliminating the deduction at a Sept. 7 event hosted by the New York Times.\n\nPresident Trump on Sept. 13 said he is advocating for a tax plan that would aim to provide tax relief for the middle class and businesses. (The Washington Post)\n\n“People in states that have balanced budgets, whose state governments have done their job and kept their books balanced and don’t have big massive pension liabilities, they’re effectively paying for states that don’t,” he said. “What it is is a fairness issue. . . . Let’s let people see their true cost of government.”\n\nThe deduction clearly favors states where taxes are relatively high, and where incomes are high enough that it is worthwhile for taxpayers to itemize their deductions and claim it. According to the conservative Tax Foundation, filers in six states — California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas and Pennsylvania — claim more than half of the dollar value of the deduction.\n\nWith the exception of Texas, those states are overwhelmingly represented by Democrats, but a handful of Republicans, mainly in the House, are threatening a revolt if the GOP tax plan is balanced on their constituents.\n\nRep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), who represents a middle-class Long Island district, said he could never vote for a tax bill that eliminated the deduction, especially for property taxes.\n\n“These people have 60-by-100 [foot] plots, they’re paying about $15,000 a year in property taxes, high state income taxes, not into Wall Street, not into stocks and bonds,” he said. “It would be devastating. These are Trump voters. They didn’t vote for him to take away the deduction on their main asset.”\n\n[For congressional Republicans, it’s tax reform or die]\n\nBoth King and MacArthur doubted the GOP bill would be able to reduce rates enough to offset the cost of losing the deduction. And even if it did, they said, that would hardly suffice: “They may leave my residents at a break-even while the rest of the country enjoys tax breaks,” MacArthur said. “That’s not fair.”\n\nInterviews with a broader group of House Republicans representing districts in California, Pennsylvania, Illinois and New York found broad unease with the prospect of the deduction’s elimination. But all of them said they would see what would emerge from the “Big Six” negotiators from the White House and Capitol Hill, who are expected to release an outline later this month and examine how it would affect their constituents.\n\nRyan suggested “there are ways of ameliorating the effects” of eliminating the SALT deduction, pointing specifically to plans for doubling the standard deduction available to taxpayers who do not itemize. Do that, he said, and “you take care of middle-income people for that tax break, and it’s really a high-end, wealthy person’s tax break.”\n\nEllis said there are other ways tax writers could choose to scale back the deduction without inflicting too much political pain: by simply capping it, for instance, or by implementing a broader limitation on itemized deductions for high-income earners. Republicans are also proposing to eliminate the alternative minimum tax, he noted, which tends to affect a similar population as those who claim SALT deductions.\n\nNot all legislators from high-tax states are opposed to rolling back the SALT deduction; a few believe it could send a needed message to free-spending legislators in statehouses and city halls.\n\n“The question is: Should taxpayers in low-tax states be subsidizing the taxpayers in high-tax states?” said Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), a member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee. “It’s not clear to me why that’s good policy.”\n\nSteven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the liberal-leaning Tax Policy Center who opposes eliminating the SALT deduction, said it would essentially raise the cost of state taxes and thus increase pressure on officials to cut them — at a time when Washington is transferring more costs, especially health care, to the states.\n\n“They’re shifting the expense and kicking them when they’re down, making it harder for them to raise the revenue for these new federal mandates,” he said.\n\nBut Rosenthal said Republicans, having ruled out higher taxes on assets and investment, have few easier choices available to them.\n\n“I think it will have better legs this time,” he said. “Republicans need to close a few loopholes and need to hit the rich in some way in order for the package to extend the narrative that it’s not just a windfall for the rich. And the noisier the blue-state politicians are at objecting to these loopholes, the better it plays into the narrative.”\n\nRead more at PowerPost","author":"Mike DeBonis, Mike DeBonis","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T06:41:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/09/15/National-Politics/Images/Trump_57168-c23a8.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"qL3q8iwjVdz+yz4LbCx/Dg==\n"}

Hurricane Irma blew the walls and roof off her home. (Maggie Steber for The Washington Post)\n\nLynn Hernandez is a “Conch,” a fourth-generation native of the Florida Keys, and she knows from experience that the hard part isn’t the hurricane; it’s what happens now.\n\nFour days after Irma dumped wrack and wreckage on this tiny island, its residents were deep into the blisteringly hot wait for food, electricity and water.\n\nThe wait for normal.\n\n“People are a little crazy now. It’s scary,” Hernandez said, sitting on the porch of her uncle’s semi-ruined frame house two blocks from the boatyard where most of her family make their living as fishermen. It was the same after Wilma, after Georges, after Andrew (she was pregnant for that one), after all seven of the hurricanes she has ridden out here on the Straits of Florida. Because that is what Conchs do.\n\n[Hurricane Irma passed by one Florida coast and slammed into another]\n\nShe had her face in one hand and a warm Bud Light in the other, a little beery and a little teary recalling the post-Irma traumas: the two men she saw get into a knife fight near the marina, the old man they found dead in his apartment down the street, the boy who came around selling jewelry soon after reports of looting from the Zales store across the bridge.\n\nAnd suddenly, trauma was upon her again. She looked up as the normal background barking of dogs reached a frenzy, then a shattering scream: “No, they’re killing her!” she heard.\n\n\n\nLynn Hernandez, 50, sits on the porch of her uncle’s house on Stock Island. (Maggie Steber for The Washington Post)\n\nHernandez ran from the porch and saw two big dogs that had been left behind by neighbors who heeded evacuation orders ahead of Irma’s arrival. The dogs had been making a racket since the storm, and now they had gotten loose and were leaping around a young woman and the small white dog she was trying to protect. The little animal’s blood was already staining the front of her Key West High School shirt.\n\n“Oh, no; oh, no,” the girl said after bystanders chased off the attackers. “She’s dying.”\n\nHernandez looked, saw that the girl was right and hugged her.\n\n“It’s not your fault,” she said. “They’re in survival mode.”\n\nHernandez sat, cradling the fading animal.\n\n“It’s not the storm. It’s the aftermath,” she said, her voice still shaking. “Honestly, I don’t mind the wind.”\n\nAn on-the-ground look at the city of Marathon in the Florida Keys after Hurricane Irma. (Dalton Bennett,Zoeann Murphy/The Washington Post)\n\n‘What I really want is ice’\n\nThe Florida Keys, a bead string of causeway-connected islands dangling 113 miles into the ocean from the tip of the state, took the brunt of Irma’s landfall when its eyewall rolled right over the archipelago. Between Islamorada and Stock Island — which abuts Key West — there are swaths of dramatic wreckage, mostly where the wind and water tossed around trailers, campers and boats.\n\nBut the construction codes in place since Hurricane Andrew’s 1992 devastation of the state have hardened Florida’s homes, even here in one of the most vulnerable environments. Most of the affected structures looked damaged but not destroyed. Once the tons of debris are gone, the power grid restrung and hundreds of bent-but-not-broken roofs repaired, the Keys will be up and waiting for the next tropical tempest.\n\nHernandez’s turquoise block home on Stock Island is one that was bruised but livable; Irma twisted part of her metal roof into ribbons. That’s fine, that’s what she expected. Fixing a roof is better than leaving your home behind and being stuck in the angry line of cars at Mile Marker 74, where officers still won’t let evacuees back in.\n\n“Conchs don’t leave,” said Cassandra Greene, who was out front of her home three blocks away, grilling the last of the pork chops she packed in coolers before the storm.\n\n“The Keys always come through,” said her husband, Jimmy Greene, a water and sewer worker on Key West who grew up here. He was petting the emaciated stray dog that took up with them during the storm. “We stay, and then we help each other out.”\n\n1 of 9 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Signs of life after Hurricane Irma hit the Florida Keys View Photos Abandoned objects show intimate glimpses of life on Islamadora and Stock Island before the hurricane’s destruction Caption Abandoned objects show intimate glimpses of life on Islamadora and Stock Island before the hurricane’s destruction September 13, 2017 A an abandoned Florida license plate and a pair of binoculars near the Sea Breeze Mobil Home Park in Islamorada, Fla.

Hospital staff, utility workers, other “essential” personnel, were being let back in. Supply trucks loaded with generators, portable toilets and telephone poles filled southbound U.S. Route 1. With boats still on some side streets and most of the fallen trees still lying where Irma dropped them, the Lower Keys were crawling with residents, repair crews and relief groups.\n\nOne was giving away gasoline at the post office on Big Pine Key. National Guard members handed out emergency rations, water and ice at Sugarloaf Elementary on Sugarloaf Key. A line stretched around the Winn-Dixie, which was letting people in 10 at a time for five minutes of cash-only shopping.\n\nOn Stock Island, a uniquely Keys mix of working-class trailers and modest vacation homes, residents were tracking giveaways via the generator-powered FM station, 104.1. Cellphone coverage was limited to the reach of emergency towers; cable TV and Internet service were pre-Irma memories, along with air conditioning and fresh food.\n\n“It’s as bad as I’ve ever seen, but every day it feels a little more like normal,” said Hernandez’s neighbor, Kevin Edwards, 41, a military jet mechanic who was allowed to return Tuesday.\n\nEdwards spent two days in 90-degree heat clearing a ficus tree off the front of his house and a Brazilian pepper tree off the back, going from 234 pounds to 219 in the process. When officials announced a two-hour window to flush toilets and bathe with water that still can’t be consumed, he took a 45-minute shower, until the water backed up in his sink.\n\n“The system’s not there yet,” he said.\n\nA Monroe County sheriff’s car pulled slowly down the street, forcing a rooster to scamper to the side. “If you need food or water, go to the Tom Thumb parking lot,” the officer intoned through a loudspeaker.\n\n“We’ve pretty much run out of food,” Hernandez said when the car passed her house. An empty box labeled “Emergency Ration Meals” sat on a pile of reeking seaweed in her yard. “What I really want is ice, something cold to drink.”\n\n\n\nStock Island resident Jimmy Greene surveys wind damage as he takes his dog for an early evening walk Thursday.

At 83, he’d stuck through many a storm, but this was the first he went through without Phyllis. She died in July, just shy of their 60th anniversary.\n\nHis house, modern, built to code on eight-foot block piers, was undamaged. He had looked down at the water washing over his yard from the lonely safety of his porch.\n\n“My wife hated all these stairs,” he said softly. “I don’t know. Everything has changed. Everything.”\n\nAt that minute, Jimmy Greene walked by, his own dog Roxie on a leash. Harris called hello and thanked Greene for a favor he’d done him earlier in the day: taking his car to get filled up at the one station on the island with gas.\n\n“That line was 60 cars long,” Greene said, shaking his head.\n\nGreene walked down Cross Street, past the fences crushed by the storm surge and the piles of rotting garbage, past the “Looters Will Be Shot” sign painted on the plywood still covering the window of a pink cottage.\n\n“Some of these houses, where they didn’t clear out the fridge before they evacuated,” he said sniffing, “everything’s starting to stink.”\n\nHe stopped. “Now look at that.”\n\nIt was a trailer with its front end blown off. In the now open-air kitchen stood a woman putting dishes neatly away, as though she had just finished a meal.\n\nStock Island resident Michael Knoles stands with the front door of his house Thursday. (Maggie Steber for The Washington Post)\n\nShe was Jacqueline Rodriguez, a maid at the DoubleTree Hilton on Key West. She and her husband, who took refuge at another motel during the storm, were doing what they could to feel better about the fact that their home was a total loss.\n\n“We’re alive,” she said in Spanish. It was all she could muster.\n\nAcross the street, a man came out of his low-slung, branch-covered house the only way he could: removing the warped front door from its hinges, stepping out and then putting it back.\n\nHe was Michael Knoles, a removal technician for the Key West mortuary. Without working phones, police had for days been coming to knock on his busted front door when they needed a body collected — from the hospital, from houses, from boats.\n\nThe official death toll from Irma has been remarkably low, a combination of people getting out of the way of the storm and a bit of luck as the storm weakened and went inland. But locals say the people dying since the storm could have been affected by the stress.\n\n“A lot of heart attacks,” Greene said. “Folks are running out of their medicine.”\n\n“It’s been busy,” Knoles said.\n\nGreene, who was holding a can of Heineken, looked at Knoles, who was holding a can of Glory Foods collard greens.\n\n“You got a can opener for that?” Greene asked.\n\n“That’s what I’m looking for,” Knoles said.\n\n“Got one at the house,” Greene said, starting down the block in the last rays of the tropical sunset. “Come on.”","author":"Steve Hendrix, Steve Hendrix","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T08:40:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/09/16/Others/Images/2017-09-15/L1070473.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"nBrkIRHZYJL3A0FGJCIAHw==\n"}

Ambassador Nikki Haley said on Sept. 15 that the U.N. \"is not just about talking, it's about action\" ahead of the General Assembly in New York. (Reuters)\n\nU.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said on Sept. 15 that the U.N. \"is not just about talking, it's about action\" ahead of the General Assembly in New York. (Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump’s first address to the United Nations, the world body he once said risked becoming an irrelevant salon, will be a test of his “America First” agenda on global engagement, climate change and North Korea, but one topic — Iran — looms largest.\n\nTrump’s speech on Tuesday, and a series of meetings he will hold next week with foreign leaders gathering here at the annual U.N. General Assembly, are freighted with expectations that the U.S. leader wants to pull away from the 2015 U.N.-backed nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nTrump faces an Oct. 15 deadline to say whether Iran is complying with terms of the deal and whether he considers the agreement to be in the U.S. national interest. His administration has recently signaled that he is likely to say no, raising the specter of renewed U.S. sanctions and the possibility that the deal would fall apart.\n\n“You’ll see what I’m going to be doing very shortly in October,” Trump told reporters Thursday when asked about his decision. “The Iran deal is one of the worst deals I’ve ever seen. Certainly, at a minimum, the spirit of the deal is just atrociously kept.”\n\nThe president added that “the Iran deal is not a fair deal to this country. It’s a deal that should have never, ever been made. . . . We are not going to stand for what they are doing with our country. They’ve violated so many different elements, but they’ve also violated the spirit of that deal.”\n\nWhite House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said on Sept. 15 the U.S. was approaching the limit of what sanctions and diplomacy can accomplish on North Korea. (Reuters)\n\nMost who will be in the audience for Trump’s speech disagree. The European Union, one of the architects of the deal, hopes to hold a meeting of the signatories, including Iran, on the sidelines of the General Assembly session.\n\n“This agreement is a very important agreement,” U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said Wednesday. “It contributed to an important de-escalation at the moment, and it is a factor of stability. And it’s my opinion that all parties should do everything possible for this agreement to be preserved.”\n\nWhite House officials sketched out an ambitious series of events for Trump, including bilateral meetings Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nTrump is expected to focus on “Iran’s destabilizing behavior, including its violation of the sovereignty of nations across the Middle East,” national security adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters Friday.\n\nThe president also will have lunch with Guterres, and he’ll meet with leaders of Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, the United Kingdom, Egypt, Turkey, Afghanistan and Ukraine. And Trump will hold a trilateral dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in to discuss North Korea’s nuclear weapons threat.\n\nWhile Trump’s debut on Tuesday is perhaps the most highly anticipated moment, the U.N. gathering is also notable for who will not be there — Russian President Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping, who are skipping this year’s meeting. Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto head of Burma, also will not attend amid a spate of government-backed ethnic violence in that country that has drawn international condemnation.\n\nTrump has been a skeptic of international organizations such as the United Nations and NATO. He pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement and an Asia-Pacific trade accord, promoting a foreign policy aimed at limiting U.S. interventionism abroad in favor of domestic priorities.\n\nYet Trump administration officials said the president and his team are intent on having a strong presence and demonstrating leadership in New York on issues including terrorism, trade and human rights. Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will join Trump in the U.S. delegation.\n\n“No one is going to grip-and-grin,” U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said of handshake photo-ops. “The United States is going to work. . . . This is a time to be serious, and it’s a time for us to talk out these challenges and make sure there’s action that follows it.”\n\nAs he did with NATO, Trump has pressed the United Nations for reforms, and Haley emphasized that the administration has seen improvements. She said the world body has moved away from “focusing on the commas and the periods” of toothless resolutions and begun taking stronger actions.\n\nShe cited recent decisions by the global body to enact sweeping economic sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic weapons program.\n\nHaley said the sanctions will hurt Pyongyang, but quickly added that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un does not end his provocative missile and nuclear tests, the United Nations will run out of options.\n\n“Having said that, I have no problem kicking it to [Defense Secretary James] Mattis because I think he has plenty of options,” she said, alluding to military power.\n\nThe administration has options on Iran, too, which has colored Trump’s engagement with U.S. allies and partners since his surprise victory in November.\n\nChampions of the Iran nuclear deal were reassured when Trump twice acted to certify Iranian compliance. Those notifications, required by Congress, were taken as a sign that Trump might complain about the deal but would not “rip it up” as he had pledged to do as a candidate.\n\nNow administration officials are telling allies they want to strengthen the deal, at the least.\n\nHaley recently said the deal cannot be “too big to fail,” no matter the heavy investment of important U.S. allies in keeping it intact. And Tillerson said Thursday that Iran is “clearly in default” of expectations and responsibilities under the deal, an assertion that Iran and European allies dispute.\n\nThe U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said this month that Iran is playing by the rules.\n\nTrump is expected to cite Iranian ballistic missile activity and alleged Iranian support for terrorism and other activities as evidence that Iran is violating the “spirit” of the deal.\n\n“President Trump has made it clear to those of us who are helping him develop this policy that we must take into account the totality of Iranian threats, not just Iran’s nuclear capabilities,” Tillerson said Thursday.\n\nHe quoted from the preface to the deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. The preface says that signers “anticipate that full implementation of this JCPOA will positively contribute to regional and international peace and security.”\n\nThe Trump administration is arguing that those words convey obligations to Iran to curtail activities that would harm international peace and security.\n\n“In our view, Iran is clearly in default of these expectations of the JCPOA through their actions to prop up the Assad regime, to engage in malicious activities in the region, including cyber activity, aggressively developing ballistic missiles,” Tillerson said.\n\nOn Twitter, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the deal is not renegotiable and said a “better” deal is “pure fantasy.”\n\n“About time for U.S. to stop spinning and begin complying, just like Iran,” Zarif wrote.","author":"Anne Gearan, David Nakamura, Anne Gearan, David Nakamura","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T10:13:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/09/16/National-Politics/Images/07whitehouseA-003.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"XDryDJdeVAj/BDeFTQmmOQ==\n"}

I did not plant a gun,\" Stockley said, shaking his head, in an exclusive interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch after his acquittal. \"… I can feel for and I understand what the family is going through, and I know everyone wants someone to blame, but I'm just not the guy.\"\n\nThe interview, which appeared to be videotaped in a private indoor space, came hours after a judge released a 30-page order concluding as much: that the state had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Stockley \"did not act in self-defense\" when he shot and killed Smith, 24, during a car chase in December 2011.\n\nIt was the first time Stockley, who had been under a gag order, publicly addressed the case, which has exacerbated tensions in a region already grappling with unrest surrounding police use of force and race.\n\n[Police and protesters clash in St. Louis after former officer acquitted on murder charges]\n\n\"It feels like a burden has been lifted, but the burden of having to kill someone never really lifts,\" Stockley told the Post-Dispatch. \"The taking of a life is the most significant thing that one can do, and it's not something that is done lightly and it's not something that should ever be celebrated. And it's just a horrible experience altogether. But, sometimes, it's necessary.\"\n\nAs in trial, Stockley insisted that he did not recall saying during the car chase that he was \"going to kill this motherf—er, don't you know it,\" as outlined in court documents. Prosecutors also noted that a gun found in Smith's car was later found to contain only Stockley's DNA and accused the officer of planting the firearm.\n\nStockley said that his memory was imperfect and that the first time he heard himself saying what he did in the car was when he met with the FBI; he could only speculate as to why he had said it, \"whether it was in the heat of the moment or whether it was part of a larger conversation,\" he said.\n\n\"I can tell you with absolute certainty that there was no plan to murder Anthony Smith during a high-speed vehicle pursuit,\" Stockley told the newspaper. \"It's just not the case.\"\n\nStockley acknowledged in his interview that the \"optics\" of the case looked bad but said he had made the best decisions possible \"based on limited information and a limited amount of time.\"\n\n\"Every resisting looks bad. They never look good,\" Stockley told the Post-Dispatch. \"So what you have to separate are the optics from the facts, and if a person is unwilling to do that, then they've already made up their mind and the facts just don't matter. To those people, there's nothing that I can do to change their minds.\"\n\n[The Washington Post’s database of fatal police shootings this year]\n\nStockley declined an interview request Saturday through his attorney, Neil J. Bruntrager, who told The Washington Post that his client's conversation with the Post-Dispatch was likely a \"one and done\" situation. The trial, he said, had left Stockley emotionally exhausted.\n\n\"All you're doing is reading these articles and statements from people who are ill-informed and demonizing you, and you have no ability to respond,\" Bruntrager said. \"Think what that must be like. … I don't know how the top of his head didn't blow off.\"\n\nAs general counsel for the St. Louis Police Officers Association, Bruntrager also represented Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, in Ferguson, Mo., a St. Louis suburb. He emphasized, however, that Stockley's case preceded the Brown shooting by several years and needed to be considered individually.\n\n\"It's important to look at the video, but that's not all of the evidence … I would encourage people to read Judge [Timothy] Wilson's opinion because here's a detailed examination of the facts of the case, and it leaves no stone unturned,\" Bruntrager said. \"This wasn't a routine traffic stop. This was a drug-related stop. Those by their very nature — they're deadly.\"\n\n[U2 cancels St. Louis concert amid protests]\n\nThe judge's ruling Friday prompted protests in St. Louis, which began peacefully but, after nightfall, turned violent, according to a joint video statement by St. Louis Police Chief Lawrence O'Toole and Mayor Lyda Krewson. The clashes resulted in at least 23 arrests and 10 injured police officers, O'Toole said. Even before the acquittal, the city was bracing for protests, as The Post reported:\n\nOn Friday night, Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R), who had put the state's National Guard on standby ahead of the verdict and potential protests, chastised those who engaged in violence, saying it \"is not going to be tolerated here in the state of Missouri.\" Before the verdict was announced, Greitens stood with Christina Wilson, Smith's fiancee, to deliver a joint message asking people to protest peacefully. \"If you feel like you want to speak out, speak how you feel,\" Wilson said at the news briefing. \"And whatever comes to you, just do it in a peaceful way.\" Greitens, speaking after Wilson, urged people who felt pain after the verdict not to \"turn that pain into violence.\" \"One life has been lost in this case, and we don't need more bloodshed,\" he said.\n\nIn his interview with the Post-Dispatch, Stockley said he was concerned the ensuing protests would escalate to violence.\n\n\"My main concern now is for the first responders, the people just trying to go to work and the protesters,\" Stockley told the newspaper. \"I don't want anyone to be hurt in any way over this.\"\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, Stockley left the St. Louis police force in 2013 and moved to Houston, where he worked as a regional project manager at TH Hill Associates, an oil and gas drilling consulting firm. He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 2002 with degrees in philosophy and nuclear engineering; afterward, Stockley served in the Army in Iraq, where he received a bronze star, and was honorably discharged after an injury, Bruntrager said.\n\nStockley told the Post-Dispatch on Friday that he had been apart from his family and had no plan besides \"not to let this dictate my life.\" When asked what he might have done differently on that day in December 2011, he responded: \"Take the day off.\"\n\n\"I don't know how changing any number of my actions that day would have changed the outcome,\" he told the newspaper. There was one main reason he had agreed to speak about the case.\n\n\"Because I didn't do anything wrong,\" he said. \"If you're telling the truth, and you've been wrongfully accused, you should be shouting it from a mountaintop.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nA cop stopped a car for speeding — then pointed a gun at a passenger for more than 9 minutes\n\nTeen girl files claim against police who mistook her for a black male suspect and punched her\n\nA Utah nurse's violent arrest puts patient-consent law — and police conduct — in the spotlight","author":"Amy B Wang, Amy B Wang","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T06:48:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MkbDVR3bFe1jEqHzY0ykuBWgH_Y=/1484x0/https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IKXNSILP6E23ZJHTCPDE4DNA3U.png","digest":"aD0CZa1QxhDTril/SoFIHg==\n"}

(Nate Raymond/Reuters)\n\nAs President Trump’s voter fraud commission prepared to convene in New Hampshire this week, it already faced questions about its seriousness of purpose and whether it was a hopelessly biased endeavor.\n\nThen things got worse.\n\nAn email surfaced in which the Heritage Foundation’s Hans von Spakovsky, one of the commission’s most conservative members, lamented that Trump was appointing Democrats and “mainstream” Republicans to the bipartisan panel.\n\nIts vice chairman, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), drew rebukes from voting rights advocates — and a couple of fellow commissioners — for an article he wrote for the hard-right Breitbart News website. The article asserted, without proof, that voter fraud had likely changed the result in New Hampshire’s most recent U.S. Senate race.\n\nA third Republican on the panel, J. Christian Adams of Virginia, later feuded on Twitter with a journalist, questioning whether she had lied about her academic credentials. She had not.\n\nOn Aug. 1, a federal judge declined to block the president's voter fraud commission from collecting voter data. A lawsuit attempting to block the collection of voter data could now go to a federal appeals court. (Patrick Martin/The Washington Post)\n\nThe fresh controversies angered some Democratic commissioners already feeling heat from their party for taking part in Trump’s commission, which critics say is really aimed at making it more difficult to vote. Even some Republicans following the commission and sympathetic to its mission said it may now face an even tougher job of selling any recommendations it crafts.\n\n“Let’s just say the execution has been less than perfect,” said Barry Bennett, a campaign adviser to Trump last year. The ongoing “fusses” could make it more difficult for the commission to make its case, Bennett said.\n\nThe Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity was formed in response to Trump’s baseless claim that millions of illegally cast ballots cost him the popular vote against Hillary Clinton last year. Leading members — including Vice President Pence, who serves nominally as chairman — have nevertheless insisted they launched their work with no preconceived notions and would follow the facts wherever they might lead.\n\n[Trump’s voter commission hasn’t even met — and it’s already off to a rough start]\n\nBy the end of a seven-hour meeting on Tuesday, some Democratic members of the panel were openly questioning that proposition, saying they had witnessed a one-sided parade of testimony by conservative analysts that overstated the evidence of voting fraud.\n\n“I don’t think we’re going in a productive direction right now,” said Matthew Dunlap, Maine’s secretary of state and one of five Democrats on the 12-member commission. “The panels were dominated by darkness and foreboding.”\n\nDunlap said in an interview that he was highly offended by von Spakovsky’s email, which was released later in the day by an advocacy group that had unearthed it through a public-records request. The email, which was eventually forwarded to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was written in February, as Trump was preparing to make appointments to the panel.\n\n“There isn’t a single Democratic official that will do anything other than obstruct any investigation of voter fraud,” von Spakovsky wrote in the email, relaying that he had just learned that Trump intended to make the panel bipartisan. “That decision alone shows how little the [White House] understands about this issue.”\n\nVon Spakovsky added that “if they are picking mainstream Republican officials and/or academics to man this commission it will be an abject failure.”\n\nDunlap said van Spakovsky was trying to keep people like him from serving, adding that he is well-respected by legislators in both parties in Maine.\n\n“It really taints Mr. Spakovsky’s participation on the commission,” Dunlap said. “If he had any dignity, he’d step down.”\n\nThrough a spokeswoman, von Spakovsky said he “no plans whatsoever” to step down, had written the email to “private individuals” and had no idea it would be forwarded to Sessions or become public. The copy of the email released by the Justice Department redacted the name of the original recipient.\n\nAdams — who has conducted years of research on voting by noncitizens, including in Virginia — said that the widespread opposition to the commission’s work by Democrats was in effect “proving Hans right.”\n\n“Some people don’t want to get to the truth about vulnerabilities in our elections,” he said of the panel, which he also said includes some open-minded Democrats.\n\nFor his part, Adams said that he considered the meeting in New Hampshire to be “fantastic” and that it showed there are areas where Republicans and Democrats can “work together to fix vulnerabilities in the election system.”\n\nDemocrats are not alone in criticizing the panel.\n\nMichael Steele, a former Republican National Committee chairman, said he has not been a fan of the commission from the outset. Its attempts to address voter fraud amount to “taking a bulldozer to a problem that could you could probably use a shovel on,” he said.\n\n“There’s no reason to go down this road and create all these political firestorms,” Steele said.\n\nKobach’s Breitbart piece ignited one of the firestorms, and the most dramatic moment of this past week’s meeting came when New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner, a Democrat on the commission, confronted Kobach about the column.\n\n“You questioned whether our election as we have recorded it is real and valid,” Gardner said to Kobach, “and it is real and valid.”\n\nHe added that Kobach’s article was not helpful for a commission trying to convince the public that it had reached no preordained conclusions.\n\n“I hope we all learn from this,” Gardner said. He also relayed that he was resisting calls from his all-Democratic congressional delegation to resign from the commission, saying he considered it his civic duty to continue serving.\n\nKobach, who has aggressively pursued cases of voter fraud in Kansas, argued in his Breitbart piece that the U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire, which was decided by 1,017 votes, “likely” turned on illegally cast ballots. He pointed to state data showing that 5,313 people with out-of-state driver’s licenses registered to vote on Election Day but did not apply later for New Hampshire licenses.\n\nVoting rights advocates say many of those appear to be college students, who are allowed to vote under state law.\n\n“Very somberly, he waves the bloody shirt of voter fraud, and it’s just people complying with the law,” Dunlap said of Kobach. “How does that help his cause?”\n\nAlan King, another Democrat on the commission, said he had misgivings as well about the direction in which his Republican colleagues are moving.\n\n“If we’re just going to parade people through to say what they want them to say, this isn’t a good approach,” said King, a probate judge in Alabama. “This nation deserves a legitimate commission that gives a fair shake to the evidence. If you don’t have that, it’s a total waste of everyone’s time.”\n\nNeither Pence’s office nor Kobach responded to multiple requests for interviews.\n\nThe commission had already sparked several controversies, including with a sweeping request to states for voter roll information that even some Republican secretaries of state said was overly broad. A federal judge also recently chastised the commission for not sharing public documents ahead of its organizational meeting.\n\nSeveral Republicans interviewed for this story suggested that Trump would have been better off tasking the Republican National Committee with looking into voter fraud rather than trying to set up a bipartisan commission operating under government rules.\n\nDoing that would allow the work to go forward without constant questions about the commission’s balance, Bennett said.\n\n“They could still produce a report that could be devastating and remove all these political fusses,” Bennett said.\n\nThe executive order establishing the commission says it will issue a report to Trump identifying laws, policies and practices that both enhance and detract from public confidence in voting, and identify weaknesses in voting systems and practices that can lead to fraudulent voting.\n\nThe recommendations would be strictly advisory and would be dependent on officials at the state, federal or local levels taking action to implement them.\n\nRegardless of the commission’s ultimate fate, some critics fear that it is making an impact by traveling the country to hold meetings and make local headlines.\n\nKristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law — one of several groups that have taken legal action against the commission — said its travels could “plant the seeds for laws and policies” to make voting harder.\n\n“In my view, part of the goal here is to take this parade on the road . . . and use the commission to promote this false narrative,” Clarke said.","author":"John Wagner, John Wagner","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T10:37:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/09/15/National-Politics/Images/2017-09-12T170912Z_398342131_RC174D59A000_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-VOTE.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"gNVJRUUZ/P8UL5bpxqYNjA==\n"}

(Reinhard Krause/Reuters)\n\nBERLIN — For the first time since the defeat of the Nazis in 1945, a far-right party will soon have delegates in the German Parliament.\n\nFounded in 2013, the Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, rode a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment to become the third-highest-polling party in the country. Pollsters say the party should get more than enough votes in Germany’s parliamentary elections this month to pass the 5 percent threshold required to send representatives to the Bundestag, Germany’s lower house.\n\nThat has caused tremendous hand-wringing in a country that takes the burden of its Nazi history seriously. Stickers that read “FCK AFD” are plastered to street signs and apartment buildings across Berlin, and media coverage hails citizens who take it upon themselves to remove swastikas etched onto grimy walls.\n\nIn the Bundestag itself, the mood is much the same. There’s a strong feeling among lawmakers that people with even tenuous ties to the Nazi Party that gutted democracy 85 years ago simply don’t belong there.\n\n“I don’t know anyone in the Bundestag among the staffers and the MPs who does not feel angry,” said one staff member from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, or CDU, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press. The sentiment was unanimous among the half-dozen staff members who spoke to The Washington Post, representing every party currently seated in Parliament.\n\nLawmakers and their staffs have spent the past few months figuring out how they might sideline the AfD once its members arrive, but doing so will be difficult. German governance is far too formalized — and rule-following perhaps far too ingrained — for such an effort to make much of a dent. But the search for even marginal ways to limit the AfD’s influence shows the extent to which Parliament sees the new party as a worry, and even a potential threat to Germany’s democracy itself.\n\n[Following the German election? Join us on WhatsApp or Messenger for updates and discussions.]\n\n“Nazis were elected to the Reichstag, too,” said the CDU staffer, referring to the parliament of the Weimar Republic. “They were treated like a normal party until they undermined any democratic ideas in Germany.”\n\nTimo Lochocki, an expert on right-wing populism at the German Marshall Fund, a Berlin-based think tank, believes those concerns are justified. Winning seats in Parliament will give the AfD an enormous platform to promote and normalize its message, along with access to massive new resources and staff, which should help beef up its organization.\n\n“Europe should be concerned,” said Lochocki. “The world should be concerned.”\n\nThe most significant attempt so far to preemptively block the AfD took place months ago. Parliamentary tradition grants the body’s oldest member the right to give the first speech of a new session. After the Sept. 24 elections, that honor could fall to Wilhelm von Gottberg, a 77-year-old AfD candidate who has previously described the Holocaust as an “effective instrument for the criminalization of Germans and their history.”\n\nThe thought of von Gottberg giving one of the most-watched speeches of the year sent a collective shudder through the Bundestag, and Merkel’s government proposed offering the first speech to the longest-serving member rather than the oldest. While she never explicitly stated that the AfD was the target of the rule change, the purpose was clear to AfD co-founder Alexander Gauland, who denounced the move as “trickery.”\n\nOther struggles are taking place further out of public view. The chairmanship of the Bundestag’s budget committee, the most powerful in the chamber, traditionally goes to the leader of the opposition — which could be the AfD this year. According to Bild, the German tabloid, committee members are contemplating rejecting any AfD member for the chairmanship.\n\n[As Germans prepare to vote, a mystery grows: Where are the Russians?]\n\nAnd even the question of the party’s physical location in Parliament has been controversial. Parties sit in the Bundestag chamber ordered from left to right according to where they fall on the political spectrum. Following that tradition would place the AfD next to the risers where Merkel’s ministers sit, a prominent position in the chamber that current members don’t want the party to occupy. And, as childish as it may seem, no current sitting party wants to sit next to the AfD, according to Bild.\n\nGerman think tanks, too, are wondering how to respond to an influx of perhaps dozens of AfD politicians. “It is a tough question. We somehow have to find a way to deal with them and include them in our work,” said an employee at the leading think tank in Berlin, sighing and looking weary. “But we worry that that would legitimize their platform even further.”\n\nSo even as official Berlin recognizes the high stakes for its liberal democracy, an effective strategy is still nowhere in sight. As the CDU staffer put it: “The truth is that nobody really knows what the proper way of dealing with the AfD is.”\n\nRead more:","author":"Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian, Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T11:00:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-09-06/Reuters/2017-09-06T221238Z_1438655023_RC1753DE1190_RTRMADP_3_GERMANY-ELECTION-MERKEL.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"xHnVeh8CsTPqZItErzC54Q==\n"}

Illness, job loss and other emergencies can force people to tap their nest eggs sooner than expected. And millions of Americans, about one in two workers, still don’t have an easy way to save for retirement.\n\nWith his latest work, Benna, 75, is trying to tackle the issue of access. The former benefits consultant has released a guide for small-business owners that points them to little-known tools to make it easier for employees to save for retirement — all while keeping their costs and liabilities low.\n\nHis efforts are playing out as House Republicans are considering a key change to 401(k)s as part of their tax overhaul package: Taxing the money that workers place in their savings plans upfront instead of years later when they take it out in retirement.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers, states and small businesses are experimenting with ways to expand access to retirement accounts, which some say is the biggest obstacle of people saving enough for retirement.\n\nWhy is it still so hard for Americans to save for retirement?\n\nBenna and other experts who have studied ways to help Americans feel financially secure in retirement shared their view. We spoke with Mark Iwry, a former Treasury official who helped define programs meant to encourage people to save through auto-enrollment in retirement plans. Teresa Ghilarducci, an economics professor at the New School for Social Research in New York and a longtime consumer advocate, says the current system needs to be replaced with something that reduces the burden on workers.\n\nHere is what they had to say:\n\nRetirement accounts are complicated.\n\nWhen Benna first started trying to persuade employers to use a 401(k), the accounts were supposed to supplement pension income. Instead, many employers tried to save money by freezing or eliminating pensions, making the 401(k) the main retirement plan. In 2015, only 5 percent of employers offered traditional pensions to new hires, down from about half in 1998, according to the benefits consultant Willis Towers Watson. The trend shifted the risk and the burden of preparing for retirement to the worker.\n\nAs the accounts rose in popularity, they also grew more complicated, Benna said. The original 401(k) had two investment options and could be explained in less than a minute, he said: “It was simple and it was attractive.”\n\nToday, the accounts require ordinary workers to make sometimes complicated investment decisions and to wade through layers of fees charged by financial firms and advisers.\n\n“It morphed into something that got ugly,” Benna said. “With that added complexity came a lot of added cost.”\n\n\n\n(Jakub Jirsak/iStock)\n\nPeople tend to procrastinate.\n\nMany people saving for retirement don’t take advantage of a force that could offer a tremendous advantage: time. Thanks to the power of compound interest, or the ability of small investment gains to add up over time, people who start squirreling away money earlier can save smaller amounts than people who begin saving later in life. For every dollar you don’t save in your 20s, you need to save three or five dollars in your 50s and 60s to make up the difference, depending on how stocks and other investment markets perform.\n\nBut in many ways, the system runs contrary to human nature, Ghilarducci says. It’s not easy for people who are worried about establishing their careers, starting families and paying off debt to plan for retirement.\n\n“People don’t act like Excel spreadsheets,” she said. About one in five workers reach their late 50s and early 60s with no money saved, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve.\n\nConsumer advocates and retirement experts say the way to get more people to save is twofold. The first step is to give everyone access to a retirement account. The next is to make it seamless for people to sign up.\n\nWorkers are much more likely to participate in a savings plan when their employers automatically enroll them. Iwry saw the power of automatic enrollment firsthand nearly 20 years ago. Workers who didn’t want to contribute to a retirement account could opt out or reduce their contribution rate at any time. So people have to take action to avoid saving, Iwry says. “We’ve enlisted inertia on the side of saving,” he says.\n\nAt some companies, the share of workers who were participating in the retirement plan increased to about 90 percent with automatic enrollment, Iwry says. Participation also rose among some groups that were least likely to use a retirement account, including African Americans, Latinos, women and low-wage workers.\n\nHalf of workers are left out.\n\nPeople who do not have access to a plan at work can open an individual retirement account on their own, but few people ever get around to it. Workers who have access to a retirement plan through their jobs are 15 times as likely to save for retirement, according to AARP.\n\nPeople who work part-time or who work for a small business are less likely to receive a retirement plan through their jobs.\n\nSeveral states have stepped in by passing laws that would create state-run retirement accounts. Under many of the models, states would automatically enroll workers into IRAs or create a retirement marketplace for small businesses that don’t have plans. The efforts have faced resistance from some business groups and Republican lawmakers who say they are worried that the programs may encourage employers to drop their existing retirement plans.\n\nNow Benna is trying to make it easier for small businesses to offer retirement plans by bringing renewed attention to the payroll deduction IRA, which allow workers to contribute to an IRA directly from their paychecks.\n\n“The major barriers for a lot of smaller employers are complexity, cost compliance and fear of liability exposure,” Benna says.\n\nEmployers wouldn’t need to do much in addition to setting up the payroll deduction similar to the way that they allow workers to have their paychecks split among several checking accounts. In each of Benna’s models, the worker is responsible for opening the account and determining how the money should be invested. Employers do not shoulder any liability.\n\nIncentives don’t match those who need them the most.\n\nThe tax code is the government’s main tool for encouraging people to save for retirement. Workers don’t need to pay taxes on the earnings they put into a retirement account such as a 401(k) and the investments grow tax-free until retirement. But not all workers benefit equally by using these accounts, Iwry says. A person in the 25 percent tax bracket, for instance, saves about 25 cents in income taxes for every dollar saved. Someone in the 10 percent tax bracket saves only a dime.\n\nIf policymakers want to encourage more low-income and middle-income workers to save, they need to offer incentives that will benefit them, Iwry said. Currently, the tax credit applies only to single people with income up to $31,000 and married couples with income up to $62,000. The credit maxes out at $1,000, but most people who qualify receive much smaller amounts, he said.\n\nAnd despite the benefits of auto-enrollment, Ghilarducci said that any plan that makes participation voluntary is still likely to fall short. “Imagine if Social Security were voluntary and you sat around when you were 18 trying to determine if you should pay the [payroll] tax,” she says.\n\nGhilarducci says policymakers should create a system that requires workers to contribute a minimum amount to a retirement account that could supplement their Social Security income. Workers would receive lifetime benefits that vary based on how long they worked and how much they’ve contributed, similar to a pension. But unlike a pension, workers would not be promised a set dollar amount, she says.\n\nThe benefits paid off every year can be based on the performance of the investments in the retirement account. Ghilarducci said her proposal has been held back by the same challenges hindering retirement savings overall. Just as individuals are less likely to save until they’re close to their golden years, lawmakers and industry groups may drag their feet on crafting a solution until the retirement crisis is full blown.","author":"Jonnelle Marte, Jonnelle Marte","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-15T08:08:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/09/17/Business/Images/brooks0918HiRes-0312.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"2FcOqIGjb4TdSmsAaiGeUg==\n"}

They’re small, so it’s hard to push things too far. The company also doesn’t have much in the way of competition when it comes to market share — the Apple Watch is the rare bright spot in the smartwatch market.\n\nOn the face of it, the Watch Series 3 maintains that trend. Beyond red accenting on the crown and an ever-so-slightly thick heart rate monitor, the product is virtually indistinguishable from its predecessor. As ever, the big changes are inside. First, there’s the markedly more robust processor that brings new functionality like Siri’s voice baked directly into the device.\n\nAs anticipated, however, the big news here is optional LTE. It’s not the first watch to offer the feature certainly, but for those many users for whom “Apple Watch” and “smartwatch” are synonymous, it’s a way to rethink the space. The ability to make calls without a phone on hand is nice — and I’m told people still communicate that way — but its on-the-go Apple Music (coming in about a month) and mobile payment are the real new paradigms here.\n\nThe company has long fancied the Apple Watch a fitness nicety, and that impulse has only grown in recent years. As countless analysts have noted, it continues to be the primary driver for smartwatch purchases, even as plenty of far cheaper fitness bands continue to flood the market. This means finally ending that awkward era of strapping a phone on your arm, or trying to keep it from falling out of your pocket as you run.\n\nTo me, however, the most compelling feature is one that monitors irregular heartbeats while the wearer is sitting still. I can’t see a future where Apple claims to have a truly medical device, but these sorts of smart everyday additions are a great way to make a consumer device truly work for the wearer in a meaningful way — and the fact that the company has teamed with Stanford to bring it to the world certainly adds legitimacy.\n\nLike the iPhone X, the release of two tiers (LTE and not) is a way of helping the product reach an even wider range. Cellular connectivity isn’t for everyone, but it will definitely change a lot of workouts.","author":"Brian Heater","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-12T22:07:06.000Z"},"source":"techcrunch","urlToImage":"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/3q3a0803.jpg","digest":"6gxQtc6YKsBm1DqNUdYpQA==\n"}

(Jeff Chiu/Associated Press)\n\nIn what appeared to be an act of defiance against President Trump and to the dismay of many in law enforcement, California lawmakers took a significant step toward making the state a so-called “sanctuary state.”\n\nThe California Senate on Saturday passed Senate Bill 54, controversial legislation that would protect undocumented immigrants from possible deportation by prohibiting local law enforcement agencies, including school police and security departments, from cooperating with federal immigration officials. It also forbids law enforcement from inquiring about a person’s immigration status.\n\nThe California Values Act provides an expansive protection to the state’s undocumented population, estimated to be about 2.7 million, at a time when the Trump administration continues an aggressive crackdown on those who are in the country illegally and on so-called sanctuary cities — communities that limit local law enforcement’s cooperation with immigration agents.\n\nThe strictly party-line vote sends the bill to California Gov. Jerry Brown (D), who is expected to sign it in to law.\n\nKevin de León (D-Los Angeles), president pro tempore of the state Senate and California’s most powerful Latino politician, introduced the bill in December. It sailed through the state Senate and Assembly without Republican support.\n\n“Once signed into law and enacted, SB 54 will prevent state and local law enforcement officers and resources from being commandeered by President Trump to enforce federal laws,” de León said in a statement Saturday, adding later: “Our undocumented neighbors will be able to interact with local law enforcement to report crimes and help in prosecutions without fear of deportation — and that will make our communities safer.”\n\n[Trump and Democrats strike DACA deal. Yes? No? Sort of? Trump’s world can be confusing.]\n\nAssemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher (D-San Diego) agreed, saying California’s “families, schools, workplaces and communities” will be safer.\n\nThose in law enforcement, however, disagreed.\n\nThe California State Sheriff’s Association, which has vocally opposed the bill, said that limiting public safety agencies’ ability to cooperate with immigration agents places communities at risk.\n\n“We are disappointed that the Legislature chose political symbolism over public safety in approving SB 54,” the association said in a statement.\n\nBrown and de León reached a compromise this week that would allow law enforcement some flexibility. For example, the bill would give law enforcement discretion to cooperate with immigration agents if a person has been convicted of a serious or violent felony and any felony punishable by imprisonment in a state facility.\n\nOfficials can report a person who has been convicted in the past 15 years of unlawful possession or use of a weapon, driving under the influence, or drug- and gang-related offenses, as long as those crimes were felonies.\n\nThe revision also requires the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to give inmates credits toward reducing their sentences, regardless of their immigration status, if they complete educational and rehabilitative programs.\n\nThe compromise was accepted by immigration advocates but did not persuade law enforcement organizations to support the bill. In a statement after the deal was reached Monday, the California State Sheriff’s Association said that despite the changes, “the bill still goes too far in cutting off communications with the federal government.”\n\n“Our overarching concern remains that limiting local law enforcement’s ability to communicate and cooperate with federal law enforcement officers endangers public safety,” the association said.\n\n[Trump’s die-hard supporters are fuming after an apparent about-face on ‘dreamers’]\n\nSenate Republican Leader Pat Bates (Laguna Niguel) said in a statement that the latest amendments “may have removed some obstacles.”\n\nBut the bill, she added, “would still impose unnecessary restrictions. These restrictions will make it more difficult to stop dangerous criminals from being released into our communities.”\n\nCalifornia is not the first state to pass a sanctuary law. The Oregon legislature passed a similar bill in 1987.\n\nThe vote came just a day after a legal blow to the Trump administration’s crackdown on sanctuary cities. A federal judge on Friday blocked the Justice Department from withholding grant funds from Chicago and other cities that refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities.\n\nLast August, a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked parts of a state law that was supposed to outlaw sanctuary cities and penalize local officials for not cooperating with federal deportation efforts.\n\nBrewing in the White House and on Capitol Hill is a debate on what to do with the hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children, after Trump announced that his administration is ending the Obama-era program granting legal status to “dreamers.” Departing from a campaign promise to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, Trump said that he favors some protections for dreamers, whom he called “good, educated and accomplished young people.”\n\nMatt Zapotosky and Maria Sacchetti contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nJudge rules Justice Department can’t keep grant money from uncooperative sanctuary cities\n\nFederal judge blocks Texas’ harsh anti-sanctuary law\n\nChicago sues Justice Department over new police grant rules targeting sanctuary cities","author":"Kristine Phillips, Kristine Phillips","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T11:25:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-09-09/AP/California_Legislature_Final_Week_60125-25f59.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"N1uiGC/jSxg8+Wl2fh9LLg==\n"}

Outstanding stuff from the Celtic goalkeeper.\n\nIf County were sickened at that missed opportunity, what happened next finished them off completely.\n\nA Rogic shot was parried by McCarey straight into Forrest's path and the midfielder could not miss from close range. He added a second 16 minutes before the end, cutting in from the right and drilling a shot across the County goalkeeper.","author":"BBC Sport","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T16:08:52.000Z"},"source":"bbc-sport","urlToImage":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/00E9/production/_97833200_dembele.jpg","digest":"W5nJZGw1WhqHfd9IZ5uKVQ==\n"}

Jose’s path could put it near New Jersey and New York by Wednesday morning, although it may weaken to a tropical storm again by then, the center said.\n\nThe storm may add to an already devastating 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, coming just after Hurricane Harvey inundated Texas and Hurricane Irma raked Florida’s west coast, leaving dozens of people dead and upending energy and agriculture markets. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy created about $70 billion of damage after hitting the New York metropolitan region.\n\nAs of 11 p.m. New York time, Jose was moving northward at 7 miles per hour with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph. Jose is forecast to remain a hurricane through Monday night, the center said.\n\nData from an Air Force Reserve aircraft indicate that Jose has increased in size, the NHC said. This widens the band of hurricane-force and tropical-storm-force winds extending toward the coast.\n\nRip Currents\n\nLife-threatening rip currents are expected along parts of the U.S. East Coast, and tropical storm watches may be needed for portions of the area from North Carolina to New England during the next day or two, according to the advisory, the 47th so far about the long-lived weather system.\n\nJose could affect five refineries along the East Coast that are able to process about 1.1 million barrels a day of oil, Bloomberg data showed.\n\nIf it continues toward New York City, Jose could disrupt vessels carrying crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products along the Atlantic seaboard, “particularly those making deliveries to New York Harbor,” Shunondo Basu, a Bloomberg New Energy Finance meteorologist and natural gas analyst in New York, said on Friday.\n\nStill, some forecasters see Jose staying far enough offshore to avoid any major impact to the U.S. The hurricane center’s margin of error for a storm five days out is about 225 miles, on average.\n\nAccuWeather Inc. sees the storm tracking close enough to the coast -- within 200 miles -- to produce heavy seas and gusty winds, as well as to deliver rain to coastal areas early in the week.\n\nLandfall in New England during the middle of the week can’t be ruled out, senior meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said in a statement. If landfall were to occur, the most likely location would be far eastern Long Island or southeastern New England, especially Cape Cod.\n\nBeach Erosion\n\nThere’s a 50 percent chance of tropical storm-force winds for Nantucket, Massachusetts, by Thursday, said Jeff Masters, co-founder of Weather Underground in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nIf Jose continues on its path, the most immediate impact could be high surf and considerable beach erosion along the shores of the mid-Atlantic and New England coasts, Masters said.\n\nNorma, meanwhile, has weakened to a tropical storm as it heads north toward Mexico’s Baja California peninsula. As of 11.30 p.m. New York time, the storm was about 185 miles south of the popular tourist designation, Cabo San Lucas. Tropical storm warnings and watches are in effect, with heavy rain likely and maximum sustained winds of about 65 mph. Gradual weakening is expected for the next 48 hours, the advisory said.\n\nAs the busy 2017 storm season continues, a depression in the Caribbean was elevated on Saturday to Tropical Storm Maria and could strengthen rapidly. Hurricane watches are in effect for Antigua, Barbuda, St. Kitts, Nevis, and Montserrat, with storm watches for several other islands.\n\nWith conditions favorable, the storm “has the potential to be a hurricane by the time it passes through the Lesser Antilles Islands on Tuesday morning,” said Masters of Weather Underground.\n\nA depression west of the Cabo Verde Islands in the central Atlantic Ocean, meanwhile, strengthened into Tropical Storm Lee, the NHC said. Lee is forecast to drift slowly west or west-northwest for a few days and is not currently threatening land.","author":"Emma Ockerman","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T23:18:14.469Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iAPN.grqUHcI/v0/1200x787.jpg","digest":"V0NOYrUCsjm46ZFCGEqB9g==\n"}

This comes more than a year after the NHTSA first started looking into odors and exhaust issues in the vehicles.\n\nA Ford Explorer on display during the 2017 New York International Auto Show. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg\n\nThe NHTSA said on its website that it has upgraded the probe to an \"engineering analysis\" after receiving at least 2,719 complaints pertaining to those model year Explorers.\n\n“Our decisions are driven by the data available,\" Michael Levine, a Ford spokesman, said in an email Saturday. “When the data indicates a safety recall is needed, we move quickly on behalf of our customers.\"\n\nCrashes, Injuries\n\nThree crashes and 41 injuries have been potentially linked to the issue since July 1, 2016, according to an NHTSA filing. Some cases included complaints of nausea, headaches and loss of consciousness, all symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nWhile NHTSA said it hasn’t found substantive data to show that carbon monoxide was responsible for any of the incidents, preliminary testing suggested that “CO levels may be elevated in certain driving scenarios.”\n\nIn August, a police officer in Auburn, Massachusetts, reportedly passed out and crashed while driving a Ford Explorer SUV specially designed for law enforcement use. He tested positive for the noxious gas. A Ford representative at the time told CBS News it would be \"premature to draw conclusions\" from the incident and said a closer analysis of the car revealed a carbon monoxide concentration of 13 parts per million. The current permissible exposure limit established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is 50 parts per million.\n\nFord contended that aftermarket modifications were responsible for any carbon monoxide exposure in that incident, and the Auburn police later agreed in a statement on Facebook. The company has said that carbon monoxide, which is odorless, has been an issue only in police models of the Explorer, while other incident reports cite exhaust smells.\n\nIn 2012 and 2014, the company issued technical bulletins to dealers to alert them of complaints regarding \"an exhaust odor in the vehicle.\"","author":"Janine Wolf","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T21:58:42.719Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iPcIiMiznkAw/v0/1200x794.jpg","digest":"dDEb3w7kN7ZfyMj753/9cw==\n"}

He’ll make a decision after talks with senior Liberal Democratic Party and government officials and may announce the move as early as Sept. 28 when parliament reopens, according to NHK.\n\nA vote is most likely to be held on Oct. 29, the Sankei newspaper reported. An NHK poll last week showed that support for Abe’s ruling coalition climbed 5 points to 44 percent from a month earlier, with approval exceeding disapproval for the first time in three months. A snap election may speed up the formation of a new national political party linked to Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike to face Abe’s LDP, according to NHK, citing comments by lawmaker Masaru Wakasa.\n\nNorth Korea’s recent spate of missile tests has unnerved Japanese voters and more than two-thirds of respondents to the NHK poll approve of Abe’s strong line on the isolated nation. The main opposition Democratic Party appears to be unraveling with the resignation of several members since a new leader was voted in earlier this month.\n\n“The Democratic Party is in terrible shape, so there is no opposition to Abe,” Robert Dujarric, director of the Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies at Temple University’s Japan campus in Tokyo, said by email. “Crises such as that on the Korean Peninsula are generally good for incumbents. You can look like you’re in charge.”\n\nAbe’s Call\n\nKoichi Hagiuda, a senior LDP executive, said on Fuji Television on Sunday morning that while a decision to call a snap election rests with Abe, the party has to be ready for a vote at any time. A spokesman for the prime minister’s office said that dissolving parliament for an election is the sole prerogative of the prime minister.\n\nA general election must be held by the end of 2018. Akimasa Ishikawa, an LDP backbencher, said if Abe decides to call an election at the re-opening of parliament on Sept. 28 it could be “good timing.”\n\n“With North Korea continuing to launch missiles, Japan’s peace and security are being threatened,” Ishikawa said. “If parliament intends to continue with vacuous scandal attacks, rather than discussing security, we must draw a line under that.”\n\nParty Skeptics\n\nEven so, some members of Abe’s party are more skeptical. One senior official, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private, said a snap election may be a gamble because the ruling coalition could lose its two-thirds majority. This could slow the debate on changing the pacifist constitution to make clear the legitimacy of the nation’s armed forces, the official said.\n\n“There is also a real chance that a snap election would lead to his undoing,” said Koichi Nakano, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo. “Calling a premature election more than a year ahead of the end of the term is purely on the basis of self-interested political calculation.”\n\nAbe suffered a heavy defeat in an election for the local Tokyo assembly in July at the hands of a new party formed by Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike. This was blamed on cronyism scandals that tarnished Abe’s image. Koike’s Tomin First (Tokyo Residents First) party has yet to create a strong national base.\n\nLawmaker Wakasa repeated that he expected Tokyo Governor Koike to offer support for a national election, NHK reported.\n\nKoike spoke at an event organized by Wakasa in Tokyo Saturday, and said Japan needs “a new perspective rather than depending on politics constrained by many ties,” according to a Jiji report. Wakasa said his grouping is preparing for an election and would be able to stand some candidates in a general election.\n\nAbe’s consideration of a snap election may in part be influenced by discussion of a new national party associated with Koike, according to NHK. Temple University’s Dujarric said that Koike wouldn’t have time to prepare a challenge to Abe.\n\n— With assistance by Takashi Hirokawa","author":"Finbarr Flynn, Andy Sharp","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T23:44:26.352Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/itCXaUmzB39o/v0/1200x799.jpg","digest":"Aprafb6VhtDKYbB/WurCyA==\n"}

Facebook and Google Have the Data That Should Worry You","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-11/forget-equifax-facebook-and-google-have-the-data-that-should-worry-you","text":"Just for a minute, imagine that hackers have gained access to a database containing sensitive information about hundreds of millions of people. In this totally hypothetical scenario, the theft would be comprehensive—including enough details to do real damage to those whose data had been exposed—and would involve a company that wasn’t widely recognized as a security risk. This large company would’ve exposed you, and everyone you know, to possible financial ruin.\n\nNo, I’m not talking about Equifax, the Atlanta-based credit reporting agency that disclosed a massive hack late last week. Think of a comparable breach at Google, Facebook, or Amazon.com.\n\nThose companies, plus Slack, Tinder, and a half-dozen others, possess more than enough financial and personal data for hackers to steal our identities and, possibly, rack up fraudulent charges. They also have private messages, photographs, and most of our secrets. A large-scale attack on any one of these companies could make the Equifax hack, the theft of some 143 million Social Security numbers, look like petty larceny.\n\nFor a sense of the potential problem, I recommend John Lanchester’s recent polemic about Facebook in the London Review of Books. Lanchester dislikes Facebook on a visceral level, and his complaints are sometimes unfair, but his central point is underappreciated. “What Facebook does is watch you, and then use what it knows about you and your behaviour to sell ads,” he writes. “It knows far, far more about you than the most intrusive government has ever known about its citizens.”\n\nLanchester sees Facebook as a means of control and blames the company for the election of Donald Trump. Thanks to a recent disclosure, we know that Russian propagandists got at least some mileage out of the company’s ad program. But that’s not the most obvious way Facebook’s data could cause harm. What’s more likely than some dystopic mind-control scheme is simple and just as scary: The company could get hacked.\n\nYour personal Facebook data, as well as the data the company uses to target ads, contains information about your interests, your income, your sex life, your kids, and lots more. Google has a lot of this, plus the email inboxes of more than a billion people. It’s hard to imagine either of these companies—which employ some of the best security researchers in the world and have nearly unlimited resources—falling down on the job, but their potential adversaries are formidable, and even a small-scale hack of someone’s Facebook or Google data could do a lot of damage. Just ask John Podesta.\n\nThere’s some comfort in the fact that Silicon Valley’s tech giants generally seem way more trustworthy than your typical credit reporting agencies, which have at times been comically hostile to the interests of consumers. For decades, Equifax and its competitors—with the blessing of regulators—collected information about pretty much every American adult, offering us no way to opt out. These companies routinely report false information to lenders, potentially causing innocent consumers to be denied loans. If you don’t want this to happen to you, Equifax’s solution is a $17-a-month credit “monitoring” service. A student of the Godfather films might ask if “monitoring” is quite the right word for the sort of protection Equifax provides.\n\nAfter getting hacked in July, Equifax waited more than a month to inform the general public, even as three of its executives cashed out some of their company stock. Last week, when the announcement finally came to light, all Equifax offered us was a bug-ridden website and a year’s worth of the same old credit monitoring. There are ways to protect yourself, but the truth is that this hack could mess with people’s lives for decades. Equifax, on the other hand, may actually wind up making money on the breach, as New York Times columnist Ron Lieber points out.\n\nManaging the risk posed by these enormous data sets seems like an obvious job for regulators. Next year, new privacy rules in the European Union will, among other things, institute severe financial penalties for companies that fail to safeguard consumer data, making them less likely to profit in spite of screw-ups. The new rules will also require hacked companies to notify customers of a breach within three days. That wouldn't have stopped the Equifax hack from happening, but it would’ve cut a month off the thieves’ lead time. Something similar in the U.S. would make a lot of sense.\n\nUnfortunately, the federal government has been moving in the other direction, eroding its data-protection laws when it should be strengthening them. In April, over the objection of privacy advocates, President Trump signed a law that allows internet service providers to sell information about their customers to advertisers. This was part of an effort to put the likes of Comcast and Verizon on a level playing field with the Valley’s data brokers. The move was seen as a setback for Facebook and Google. The Equifax hack shows it was a setback for consumers, too.","author":"Max Chafkin","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-11T15:57:37.857Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ioe3qrz91RCI/v0/1200x630.jpg","digest":"vRR37NteLghpJPPeUf6T4g==\n"}

Nine St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department officers, one officer with the county and one Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper were injured during protests on Friday night, St. Louis Metro Police Department Chief Lawrence O'Toole said.\n\nThe injuries ranged from a possible broken jaw to a dislocated shoulder. Six were treated at hospitals and released, police said Saturday. There were no reports of protesters being injured, the chief added.\n\nO'Toole said Friday night that his officers showed great restraint despite injuries.\n\nVideo footage showed officers using tear gas to disperse the crowds after police said the protests were considered an unlawful assembly.

I felt like the verdict was wrong,\" Annie Smith told CNN affiliate KTVI . \"The judge made the wrong decision. ... Justice wasn't served. I (didn't) get ... justice. I could never be at peace.\"\n\nSmith's brother told KTVI he thinks the judge didn't care about the case and already had his mind made up before the trial. He said the family will look at other legal steps.\n\n\"This case ain't over,\" Antwan Johnson said.\n\nStockley expressed a sense of relief after the acquittal and said he felt vindicated that the judge ruled he had done nothing wrong.\n\n\"It feels like a burden has been lifted, but the burden of having to kill someone never really lifts,\" Stockley told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , which is a CNN affiliate.\n\n\"The taking of someone's life is the most significant thing one can do, and it's not done lightly. ... My main concern now is for the first responders, the people just trying to go to work and the protesters. I don't want anyone to be hurt in any way over this.\"\n\nStockley said that before firing his weapon, he ordered Smith to show his hands, and he believed the suspect was reaching for a handgun between the center console and the passenger seat, according to a police department report obtained by the Post-Dispatch.\n\nIn the report, Stockley said he entered Smith's car \"to locate the weapon and render it safe,\" and removed the ammunition from the silver revolver.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors argued that a revolver found in Smith's car had been planted by Stockley to justify the shooting, but the gun was never seen from the multiple cameras that captured Stockley and other officers at the scene.\n\nHe said he understood the video of the shooting looked bad to investigators and the public.\n\nEx-police officer Jason Stockley waived his right to a jury trial.\n\n\"Every resisting (arrest) looks bad.

The strike occurred as both Russian and coalition forces converged on the former ISIS stronghold of Deir Ezzor.\n\n\"Russian munitions impacted a location known to the Russians to contain Syrian Democratic Forces and coalition advisers,\" Operation Inherent Resolve, the US-led coalition, said in a news release. \"Several SDF fighters were wounded and received medical care as a result of the strike.\"\n\nThe strike occurred early Saturday, hitting an area east of the Euphrates River, near the city of Deir Ezzor.\n\nAn Operation Inherent Resolve official told CNN that the coalition denied a Russian military request to strike an area in the province of Deir Ezzor, as there were coalition advisers and US-backed Syrian forces there. But the Russians decided to carry out the strike anyway.\n\nThe source asked for his name to be withheld because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThe extent of the injuries was not clear. No coalition forces were hurt, authorities said.\n\nBoth the US-led coalition and Russia are battling ISIS in Syria, but they are on two different sides of the country's civil war. The United States and its allies support some anti-government rebel groups in their fight to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Russia backs his regime.\n\nThe fight for Deir Ezzor\n\nDeir Ezzor has been a key base for ISIS since the group first captured a majority of the city back in 2014.\n\nPro-Assad regime forces, backed by Russian airstrikes, have recently made gains there and linked up with a group of beleaguered regime soldiers that were besieged there for nearly three years, according to Syria's state-owned news agency.\n\nIn support of this push, two Russian submarines launched a barrage of cruise missiles Thursday targeting ISIS positions in Deir Ezzor, according to a statement issued by the Russian Ministry of Defense.\n\nBut the SDF recently announced its own push toward the city, \"Operation Jazeera Storm,\" and a group of its fighters have made rapid gains, capturing some 300 square kilometers (115 square miles) from ISIS along the Khabur River, which intersects with the Euphrates River just south of the city.\n\nAnd the US-led coalition carried out its own airstrikes in Deir Ezzor Wednesday, targeting ISIS fighters and vehicles.\n\nThe two simultaneous offensives in the direction of the city raised the prospect of a clash over who would be able to claim the Deir Ezzor prize. But a spokesman for the US-led coalition told reporters Thursday that the SDF would not enter the city, seemingly ensuring that the Russian-backed pro-regime troops would be the ones to capture it.\n\n\"The plan right now is not to go into the city,\" US Army Col. Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve, told reporters at the Pentagon via a teleconference from Baghdad.\n\nBut while Dillon acknowledged that the US-backed fighters would not go into the city, he said there were plenty of other ISIS targets farther down the river.\n\nThe regime and SDF advances are bringing the two forces into increasing proximity along the Euphrates, with Dillon saying Thursday that \"increased\" de-confliction was needed between Russia and the coalition as a result of the two sides being so close to one another.\n\n\"The convergence of military forces in this area calls for increased awareness and de-confliction,\" Dillon said.\n\n'Obstacles to progress'\n\nDe-confliction efforts were ramped up following a series of clashes several months ago between US-backed forces and forces allied to the regime which resulted in US warplanes downing two drones and a Syrian jet.\n\nRussian and coalition officials speak daily, and coalition officials had repeatedly cited those efforts as the reason for the absence of any such clashes in recent weeks.\n\n\"Coalition officials are available and the de-confliction line with Russia is open 24 hours per day,\" said Coalition commander Lt. Gen. Paul E. Funk. \"We put our full efforts into preventing unnecessary escalation among forces that share ISIS as our common enemy.\"\n\nHowever, their communication appeared to have broken down Saturday.\n\nDillon tweeted a photograph of coalition medics treating wounded SDF soldiers.\n\n#SDF \u0026 Coalition medics treat SDF wounded by Russian airstrike on known loc.

Old wounds and past failures color how they view their latest projects. Try as they might to separate the the personal and the professional, they can’t because their work is so close to them; it’s part of them. So when something is on the verge of not going as planned, it’s a very big crisis as we see for Joe and Donna especially in “Nowhere Man.”\n\nBefore diving into the core four, we need to talk about Anna Chlumsky, who remains incredibly charming as Katie in this episode. While “Nowhere Man” is mostly focused on her newfound relationship with Gordon and we don’t get to see much of her Chief Ontologist work, that’s fine because it’s some of the most purely entertaining and least **Prestige TV** parts of the episode: From her teasing Gordon about his love of Sneakers with a heavy Russian accent, to Gordon asking her to help him identify a song stuck in his head, it’s another way this show reaffirms that these are just people looking for connection but in the least showy way possible.\n\nTonight’s the first time Katie meets Gordon’s children. Surprisingly, she hits it off immediately with Joanie, who was rather difficult the last time we saw Gordon bring someone home in the season 3 finale. Haley, on the other hand, is very awkward about it all, especially after Joe’s outburst in the office about it (more on that in a second). While Katie’s night with the kids goes off pretty well, Gordon ends their night early because his symptoms start flaring up again and he’s exhausted.\n\nAt least part of the reason for his illness rearing its head again can be partially caused by stress at work. In the wake of Rover’s miraculous algorithm fix, Joe is spinning because he thinks Comet’s personal touch is no longer relevant. He asks Cameron to come in for a brainstorm with him and Gordon, but she says no because she thinks they should keep their work separate (Obviously, the real reason is that she feels guilty about helping his competitor). Comet is incredibly important to him, so in his mind, her saying no to helping him work through this problem is the same thing as her indecisiveness on moving in with him and running away to her airstream. Alas, Cameron doesn’t quite understand how hurt he is and runs off to the woods. Naturally, Joe isn’t in the best of moods when he arrives at the office the next day and he lashes out at Gordon when he arrives at work.\n\nEven though Rover’s fortunes have turned for the better, they aren’t able to enjoy it because Donna is very suspicious of how Cecil was able to fix the algorithm. Her suspicions weigh on her mind when she comes home and finds Joanie playing Cameron’s game Pilgrim, which turns out to be just as frustrating the review said. While Donna can’t stand to be in the same room with Cameron, she still finds herself at least mildly intrigued by the game, but for now she ignores that impulse to sit down and play it.\n\nTanya wants to use Rover’s new funding to expand its programming team, but Donna says no because she wants to see if Cecil can come through under pressure once again. This is her way of putting the screws to the team come clean about how they actually fixed the algorithm because she doesn’t believe Cecil did it on his own. She turns up the heat on him and says that they’ll only be able to hire new programmers once Cecil sits down with legal and explains how the algorithm works so that they can patent it. Unfortunately, Cecil has no idea how it works, because Cameron is streets ahead.

What it lacked, however, was consistency from the judges in a split draw.\n\nGolovkin retained his unified middleweight title on Saturday night -- Mexican Independence Day -- before a sold-out crowd of 22,358 at the T-Mobile Arena, but few were satisfied with the result.\n\nEditor's Picks Diaz edges late replacement Rivera; stays on course to title fight Featherweight contender Joseph \"JoJo\" Diaz Jr. earned a world title shot by outclassing Rafael \"Big Bang\" Rivera en route to a lopsided unanimous decision on Saturday night at T-Mobile Arena.\n\nSaunders wins; could see GGG-Canelo winner A unanimous victory for Billy Joe Saunders over Willie Monroe Jr. could give him a real shot at fighting the winner of Gennady Golovkin-Canelo Alvarez. 1 Related\n\nJudge Dave Moretti scored the fight 115-113 in favor of Golovkin, Adalaide Byrd stunningly had it 118-110 for Alvarez, and Don Trella scored the fight 114-114.\n\nThe fight began with the cheering sections for each fighter taking turns chanting \"Canelo! Canelo!\" followed by roars of \"Triple G! Triple G!\" But it was a close round with both landing a few solid shots.\n\nBoth fighters have excellent jabs, and they tried to establish it early on. Both were able to land it, but Golovkin's jab appeared heavier. When Alvarez (49-1-2, 34 KOs) went to the ropes in the fourth round, Golovkin (37-0-1, 33 KOs) went right after him. He landed right hands and body shots. Alvarez tried to duck and dodge the incoming shot, but he got clipped with a few shots before moving away.\n\nThe fight turned into a slugfest in the fifth round as the crowd went wild. Golovkin hammered Alvarez with a hard right hand that jerked his head, but Alvarez came right back, causing GGG to smile.

When he got close, he shoved jabs down the middle, and Alvarez rarely responded.\n\nGolovkin landed a hard right uppercut early in the eighth round that seemed to buzz Alvarez, who seemed to be fading, though he got in a stinging uppercut late in the round, even if Golovkin didn't budge.\n\nThey traded huge right hands early in the ninth round, but Alvarez buckled, and Golovkin didn't. Golovkin later trapped Alvarez in a corner and unloaded a right hand that knocked Alvarez's head back, but Alvarez responded by connecting with a clean right hand.\n\nThe 10th round had wild action as they exchanged power punches throughout. They were digging down deep with so much on the line.\n\nGolovkin continued to assert himself in the 11th round as Alvarez continually backed up, and then they embraced as the 12th round began.\n\nAlvarez landed a clean right in the opening seconds of the round and then connected with a four-punch combination. But Golovkin's chin is tremendous. He walked through everything and nailed Alvarez. They closed out a terrific fight slugging away in the center of the ring.","author":"Dan RafaelESPN Senior Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T04:02:18.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0916%2Fr259578_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"8loZiauhZQ3lZuVxwSFAmQ==\n"}

The brute force of Clemson's defense pulled back the curtain on Jackson's magic show, exposing the alchemy of the Louisville offense much the way it did Auburn's a week ago.\n\nIf there were concerns that Clemson wouldn't have the manpower to replace a bevy of departed offensive stars, those have long since been overshadowed by what is clearly one of the best defenses in the nation, with the Tigers utterly flustering the reigning Heisman Trophy winner in a 47-21 win over No. 14 Louisville.\n\nThat Clemson so easily dominated Kent State in Week 1 was to be expected. That this defense pummeled Jarrett Stidham to the tune of 11 sacks in Week 2 could at least be explained as a product of too much hype for Auburn. But to overwhelm Jackson, the wizard who conjured 1,010 yards of offense in his first two games and 457 yards against Clemson last season, was something else altogether.\n\nStart with Dorian O'Daniel, an afterthought on a team wrought with five-star talent, now in his fifth year on Clemson's defense. A week ago, he had 14 tackles against Auburn. On Saturday night, his interception return for a touchdown against Jackson was the backbreaker that all but sealed Louisville's fate. The most absurd part? It was Clemson's first takeaway of the season. The Tigers' D had been this good without forcing a turnover.\n\nKelly Bryant threw for 316 yards and a touchdown and added two scores on the ground, but it was the Clemson defense that stole the show Saturday. Joe Robbins/Getty Images\n\nAll of which begs the question: If Clemson's D can control the game without takeaways, if it can slow the most dynamic player in the country, if it can smother back-to-back top-15 teams, who is going to actually test this group down the road?\n\nJackson entered Saturday's game as one of the hottest players in the country, with his hopes for a second straight Heisman on the rise. He blossomed as a passer in the early season, a threat that should've intimidated any adversary. To be sure, Clemson paid him his due respect in the week leading up to the game.\n\nOn the field, however, it was one insult after another.\n\nJackson struggled badly to find receivers open downfield. He was sacked four times but bruised, beaten and battered far more often. By halftime, Clemson had run nearly twice as many offensive plays, held Louisville without a third-down conversion and led the Cardinals 19-7.\n\nBut it was just a year ago, in Clemson's Death Valley, that the Tigers held a commanding halftime lead against Jackson, only for him to unleash his magic in the second half and drag his team to within 3 yards of a victory.\n\nThis time, O'Daniel and the Clemson defense slammed the door quickly, picking off a Jackson lob and rumbling 44 yards for the end zone to give the Tigers a 26-7 lead. The score served to diminish all but the most optimistic hopes, but it also served notice: There would be no rabbits out of the hat. Jackson’s powers were useless against this defense.\n\nIn the end, Jackson padded his numbers enough in a blowout fourth quarter that his Heisman hopes didn't evaporate entirely. But while he scrambled to make something of an otherwise miserable night, Clemson's own offense kept pace.\n\nPerhaps that's the scariest thought. The season opened with a very good defense and an offense in transition. Three weeks later, the defense has exceeded expectations, and the offense is settling in.\n\nKelly Bryant appears to be a commanding presence at quarterback. Ray-Ray McCloud was brilliant. Tavien Feaster took a big step toward in carving out a hefty role in the backfield, while freshman Travis Etienne showcased his speed with an 81-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. That was Clemson's longest run play since 2007, and it followed a Bryant TD pass to McCloud that was its longest pass play since 2013. It's as if the Deshaun Watson era was just an appetizer.\n\nThe final score will suggest that this was not a test for Clemson, but let that be a credit to just how good this defense -- and team -- really is. It has been three weeks of dominance to follow a two-game playoff run in January. The list of victims -- J.T. Barrett, Jalen Hurts, Stidham and now Jackson -- is an impressive one, and the list of true threats remaining might not exist at all.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T03:42:23.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0916%2Fr259489_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"fTUX7NMKNPwHvP8vF3r7Dg==\n"}

A Feleipe Franks Hail Mary pass traveled 63 yards into the end zone and landed right in the lap of Tyrie Cleveland as time expired.\n\nIt wasn't pretty, but the 24th-ranked Gators beat No. 23 Tennessee at home on Saturday, 26-20.\n\nTo call the game a battle of wills would be an overstatement.\n\nWas it a struggle of two top-25 teams? Sure. The Gators and Volunteers were ranked -- on paper. And it certainly was a struggle to see two teams fail to execute so often offensively. The red zone proved to be a place where dreams went to die.\n\nTyrie Cleveland hauled in Feleipe Franks' Hail Mary as time expired, giving Florida a crazy win. AP Photo/John Raoux\n\nThe first time anyone found the end zone was on a pick-six by Florida freshman cornerback CJ Henderson early in the fourth quarter. It was the third interception Tennessee quarterback Quinten Dormady threw in the game and his fifth turnover in two weeks.\n\nTennessee's offense had plenty of shots but ultimately came up empty. Every time the Vols entered the red zone, they either were pushed back by the defense, missed a field goal or turned the football over. Even star running back John Kelly, who had more than 220 total yards of offense, failed when it mattered most, dropping a sure touchdown with less than a minute remaining.\n\nThat's not to say that Florida was much better.\n\nGators coach Jim McElwain, who earned his stripes as an offensive coordinator, was the picture of frustration during the game. He paced the sidelines constantly, waving his arms and speaking into his headset in search of answers that wouldn't come.\n\nThe good news -- other than a solid effort by the defense -- was that he avoided starting the season 0-2, which the Gators hadn't done since 1971. The bad news was that his offense showed hardly any signs of life even after moving coordinator Doug Nussmeier from the coaches' box to the field to call plays.\n\nIt looked for a while as if Florida would continue its offensive touchdown drought, which dated back to the fourth quarter of last season's bowl game, after Malik Davis sprinted more than 70 yards only to have the ball knocked out from behind for a fumble just 2 yards before reaching the end zone. Thankfully for him, Franks stepped in and found Brandon Powell for a 5-yard touchdown pass with 5:13 remaining in the fourth quarter to break the streak.\n\nFranks wasn't stellar overall, completing 18 of 28 passes for 212 yards, two touchdowns and an interception, but he did enough. The running game, meanwhile, picked up the pace for a respectable 168 yards.\n\nIf anything, the mediocre performance should give hope to the rest of the SEC East.\n\nFlorida, which has won back-to-back division titles, doesn't appear to have the same caliber of offense as either Georgia or South Carolina, both of which have young talent at the quarterback position in Jake Fromm and Jake Bentley, respectively.","author":"Alex ScarboroughESPN Staff Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T23:23:28.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0916%2Fr259469_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"zoh9uuxi+yrE/oxPQr4KWA==\n"}

(0:28)\n\nGAINESVILLE, Fla. -- Go back before the mob scene in the south end zone of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on Saturday night. Before Tyrie Cleveland came down with the Hail Mary pass. Before Feleipe Franks threw it. Before the play or the timeout that preceded it was ever called.\n\nIf you want to understand how Florida pulled off one of the most exciting plays of the 2017 season, beating Tennessee with no time left on the clock, you have to go back much further than that.\n\nYou can start two years ago, in fact. Back when Jim McElwain, then in his first season as head coach at Florida, called for the very first time the play he would use Saturday: “Train Right Open, Big Ben In.” It was in the same stadium, on the same 37-yard line, versus the very same team. The characters were different -- Will Grier connected with Antonio Callaway in 2015 -- but the design and the result were exactly the same: a game-winning touchdown against rival Tennessee.\n\nFast-forward a year, after Grier had transferred in the wake of a positive drug test and Franks was just a true freshman trying to learn the ropes. It was then, during a scrimmage, that Franks first showed off that cannon of a right arm. It was a 70-yard bomb that center T.J. McCoy can still picture clearly, and he swears it was Cleveland who caught the pass. McCoy and his teammates’ eyes went as big as saucers when it happened.\n\n“He’s an athlete, for real,” McCoy thought of Franks at the time.\n\nFast-forward another year, a year in which Franks rode the bench in silence and a disgruntled Florida fan base steadily grew tired of McElwain's anemic offense. This past summer, Franks and his receivers worked tirelessly behind closed doors to build chemistry. Except one day, someone let the prying eyes of the public in. In a video that popped up on Twitter and every other social media platform imaginable, Franks dropped back inside Florida’s indoor practice facility, planted his back foot in the turf and threw a beautiful, looping, 75-yard touchdown down the right side of the field. Whether Cleveland was the recipient of the pass is up for debate -- the video was grainy -- but the reaction from fans was unmistakable.\n\n“It went viral, hyping up Feleipe,” offensive tackle Martez Ivey said.\n\nThe hype didn’t seem to match the results after a dreadful Week 1 loss against Michigan. And if you want to take it a step further, through the first 58 minutes, 51 seconds of Saturday afternoon’s game against Tennessee. Franks hadn’t completed a pass more than 10 yards in the air at the time, and he was coming off an interception that had set up a game-tying field goal by the Vols.\n\nWhen Tyrie Cleveland hauled in the winning throw Saturday, it marked the second consecutive visit from Tennessee that Florida won on a 63-yard pass. Mark LoMoglio/Icon Sportswire\n\nBut with 9 seconds on the clock, McElwain called a timeout. He shouted out the play -- Train Right Open, Big Ben In -- and put his trust in his prized quarterback to make something happen. Cleveland told Franks, “Just give me a chance.” But neither Franks nor McElwain were thinking of a touchdown.\n\nTo set up a manageable field goal attempt, Franks knew he had to reach Tennessee's 38-yard line. Only the Volunteers covered up the underneath routes and the pocket collapsed. With time running out, Franks bailed. Big defensive end Jonathan Kongbo got a hand on his jersey, but he escaped.\n\nFranks said he thought about tucking and running for a first down. But then, in the corner of his eye, he saw Cleveland streaking downfield. The sophomore had a step on the cornerback -- no more than a yard, really, but enough -- and Franks pulled up, planted his back foot in the ground and heaved.\n\nMcCoy, who found himself blocking no one on the play, thought Franks had missed another open receiver. Linebacker David Reese, meanwhile, stopped talking to his position coach mid-sentence on the sideline and stood up in disbelief. Senior running back Mark Thompson said he saw the pass and thought, “Touchdown.”\n\n“I have faith in Franks and Tyrie,” Thompson said.\n\nIt was high, looping, beautiful throw from Franks. Cleveland downshifted ever so slightly and caught it like a loaf of bread, clutching it to his chest with both hands as he fell to the turf.\n\nSenior wideout Brandon Powell thought the Gators were playing for overtime, yet there he was, sprinting after Cleveland, jumping on top of him in the end zone. Cleveland lay on the turf for a few seconds, stunned, as Powell slapped his helmet and grabbed his facemask. Before long, the entire team was on top of them, in a pile celebrating the improbable 26-20 victory.\n\nIt was supposed to be a simple go route, Cleveland explained later. But the corner pressed and he ducked inside. The safety rolled out and it turned into a footrace that the world-class athlete wasn’t about to lose. “I just ran fast,” he said.\n\n“It’s that simple,” Cleveland reiterated to a stunned group of reporters. “I just ran fast.”\n\nYou see, Cleveland had no doubt.\n\n“Oh, I knew I had it,” he said. “I knew I was going to come down with it. I made it my business to come down with it. Yeah, I wanted that ball and I got it.”\n\nIt was a moment he’d been dreaming of since he was a child. To make it come true was indescribable, he said.\n\nMcElwain, who had spent much of the past week dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, was still soaking in the play when he met with reporters after the game. He said he celebrated his fair share, but mainly he stood in the locker room and watched.\n\n“It had nothing to do about me,” he said. “I enjoyed watching the guys. I just enjoyed seeing them, their excitement, because I know how hard they’ve worked, I know what they’ve put into it. So, to me, it was seeing the people in the organization enjoying the moment.”\n\nHe added later: “I’ve got some burned images in my mind that I’ll carry with me for the rest of my life.”\n\nSo did everyone else in attendance.\n\nFranks got his signature moment in his first game in the Swamp, and maybe McElwain got himself a new favorite play in the process.\n\nTrain Right Open, Big Ben In has a nice ring to it.","author":"Alex ScarboroughESPN Staff Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T03:12:17.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0916%2Fr259575_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"FCsupDH95je2yItfzhhpVQ==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"59bdfdbf03c1c0e548b2c26f"},"description":"How bad are the Colts, how good are the Chiefs and will the Patriots get their groove back?","title":"Week 2 NFL questions, stats and predictions","url":"http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/248659/week-2-nfl-questions-stats-and-predictions","text":"With one week in the books, Week 2 of the NFL kicks off with the defending champs reeling from a loss and a crop of rookies hoping to make an impact. (1:11)\n\nTaking a spin around the NFL to get you ready for Week 2:\n\nThe big questions\n\nHow bad are the Colts?\n\nPutting aside the fact that quarterback Andrew Luck is still out indefinitely, the Colts appear inept in every area after losing 46-9 to the Rams. That was the most points allowed in a season opener by the Colts since the 1954 Baltimore Colts allowed 49 points to the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThe Colts gained only 225 total yards and turned the ball over three times. Even the reliable Adam Vinatieri missed a field goal and a PAT. With the return of Luck apparently nowhere in sight, just how bad can things get for Indianapolis?\n\nWho replaces David Johnson in Arizona?\n\nThe Cardinals suffered a huge blow when running back David Johnson was placed on injured reserve this week with a dislocated wrist. Johnson was the heart of their offense after running for 1,239 yards and 16 touchdowns last year. He also figured heavily into their passing game, catching 80 passes for 879 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nThe Cardinals' offense averages only 3.3 yards per rush and 4.4 yards per play without Johnson, compared with 4.5 yards per rush and 5.6 yards per play with him. They convert only 34 percent of their third downs without him, and 42 percent with him.\n\nKerwynn Williams has been named the starting running back in place of Johnson, but it’s possible the work could be done by a committee of Williams, Andre Ellington and the recently re-signed Chris Johnson. It might take more than one player to replace David Johnson.\n\nWill the Bengals’ offense improve after Cincy fired the OC?\n\nThe Bengals fired offensive coordinator Ken Zampese on Friday, marking the first time the organization has fired a coordinator during the season in the team’s history. The team felt it had to make a change after going back-to-back games without a touchdown.\n\nQuarterbacks coach Bill Lazor will call plays going forward. The Bengals need to find a way to get the most out of players such as A.J. Green and Tyler Eifert. The Bengals were touted all summer as one of the teams to beat on offense, but have scored only nine total points. Now they go to Green Bay facing the possibility of an 0-3 start.\n\nLook for Chargers tight end Antonio Gates to have a record-breaking day against the Dolphins. Photo/Gregory Bull, File\n\nNumbers that matter\n\n1: Receiving touchdowns Antonio Gates needs to reach 111 and pass Tony Gonzalez for the most by a tight end in NFL history.\n\n9: Adrian Peterson's Week 1 offensive snaps with the Saints, the second-lowest number on the team.\n\n9: Quarterbacks the Texans have started under coach Bill O’Brien since 2014. That’s tied with the Browns for the most starting quarterbacks in that time span. Rookie Deshaun Watson is the latest.\n\n51: The Buccaneers' franchise record for most passing TDs in the first three seasons of a quarterback’s career. The record is held by Josh Freeman. Jameis Winston is one TD away from tying it.\n\n1,361: Combined yards from scrimmage by rookies in Week 1. That’s the most yards accumulated by rookies in the opening week of the season since the 1970 merger.\n\n1939: The last year a team failed to score a touchdown at home in two games. The Bengals (0-2) have tied that record.\n\n30,000: Capacity of the StubHub Center, where the Los Angeles Chargers will play their home opener this weekend. The average attendance for an NFL game last season was 68,913.\n\nWhat we’ll be talking about after Week 2\n\nThe Chiefs are the real deal\n\nThe Chiefs shot from No. 8 to No. 1 in ESPN’s Football Power Index after defeating the Patriots and are now the favorites to win the Super Bowl, according to FPI.\n\nThey travel to face the Eagles on Sunday after that Thursday night victory over the Patriots on Sept. 7. Chiefs coach Andy Reid boasts a 78.6 win percentage in games in which his team had at least nine days of rest. That’s the third-best record among coaches with at least 15 such games.\n\nThe Chiefs have plenty to be excited about with their weapons on offense, like rookie Kareem Hunt, whose 246 yards from scrimmage last week are the most in Week 1 since the 1970 merger.\n\nThe biggest question the Chiefs now face is how to replace All-Pro safety Eric Berry, who is out for the season after rupturing his Achilles in Week 1. The Chiefs will have to fill a big hole in their secondary, and that first test starts with the Eagles.\n\nThe Patriots avoid an 0-2 start\n\nThe Patriots haven’t started 0-2 since 2001, when the Tom Brady era began. They went 11-3 after Brady finished the season for an injured Drew Bledsoe and then won Super Bowl XXXVI.\n\nESPN’s FPI gives the Patriots a 59 percent chance to win their matchup against the Saints in the Superdome.\n\nAgainst the Chiefs, the Patriots allowed big performances by Alex Smith, Tyreek Hill and Hunt, giving up three plays of 50 or more yards, which is more than the Patriots have given up in any season since 2012. They have never allowed a player to have more than 200 yards from scrimmage in consecutive games in franchise history.\n\nThe Saints are two games under .500 at home since 2014 and are looking to avoid their fourth straight 0-2 start after giving up 29 points in a loss to the Vikings last week. The Saints have a 1-10 record in September since 2014, the worst in the NFL.\n\nThese are not the same Jaguars\n\nThe Jaguars, who defeated the Texans 29-7 last week, are in sole possession of first place in the AFC South for the first time since Week 15 of the 2010 season.\n\nThe Jaguars will host the Titans in Week 2 and are looking for their first 2-0 start since 2006, the fourth-longest drought in that time.\n\nThe long-suffering Jaguars appear to finally be on the upswing after registering 10 sacks and four turnovers against the Texans. The Jags have committed to improving the defense through the draft and it appears to be paying off.\n\nOffensively, rookie running back Leonard Fournette became the first player in Jaguars history to rush for 100 yards in his NFL debut.\n\nThe Titans have lost nine straight divisional road games and 14 of their past 15 divisional road games. The Jaguars ended Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota's season last year when he broke his leg, and also ended Tennessee’s playoff hopes in the process.","author":"Katherine TerrellESPN Staff Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T11:00:22.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0128%2Fr175992_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"rUGBGzZDInhajde7QzeVYQ==\n"}

Plus: Are the Cowboys the clear-cut favorites in the NFC East? And which playoff contender is in the most trouble after losing in Week 1?\n\nWhat's your top upset pick for Week 2?\n\nEditor's Picks NFL evaluators make picks on Week 2's best games We gathered a panel of NFL execs to break down the five biggest games in Week 2. Who wins Eagles-Chiefs, Cowboys-Broncos, Vikings-Steelers, Packers-Falcons and Lions-Giants?\n\nFPI ranks best games of NFL Week 2 The Green Bay Packers find themselves atop the matchup quality list for a second straight week, while surprisingly, Jaguars-Titans is the Week 2 game that will have the highest impact on the playoff race. 1 Related\n\nDan Graziano, national NFL writer: Broncos over Cowboys. I'm not overly bullish on this Broncos team, but I don't think it deserves to be a home underdog to Dallas. The Broncos looked better against the run Monday than they did in 2016, and until the fourth-quarter turnovers set in, Trevor Siemian was in control against a Chargers defense that has a lot more difference-makers than Dallas. Give me Denver to start 2-0 at home.\n\nMike Sando, senior NFL writer: Bears over Bucs. I don't see a great one, but the Bears can win at Tampa Bay under unusual circumstances. The Buccaneers could be a little rusty coming off a disruptive Week 1. Jameis Winston has not yet shown he will protect the football. The Bucs will be plenty familiar with Mike Glennon, but Glennon also will know their defense inside and out.\n\nAaron Schatz, editor of Football Outsiders: Eagles over Chiefs. The Chiefs had an offensive field day against the Patriots in Week 1, but that's partly because the Pats' defensive strength (outside cornerbacks) badly matches up with the strength of the Chiefs' offense (tight end, running back, crossing patterns). The Eagles' defense is built opposite of the Patriots': phenomenal four-man pass rush, weakness at outside cornerback. An upset is much more likely if Eagles left tackle Jason Peters is healthy enough to play, however. Philadelphia needs him to block Justin Houston.\n\nKevin Seifert, national NFL writer: Packers over Falcons. It wouldn't be the most stunning outcome in history, not after the Packers held off a strong Seahawks team in Week 1 and the Falcons barely overcame the Bears. But it would be an impressive feat to go into the Falcons' new home and win the first regular-season game there.\n\nField Yates, NFL Insider: Bears over Bucs. It's early, so we're still finding out what each team is all about. But I'll echo Mike. The Bears' front seven was active and disruptive in Week 1 against Atlanta. The Tampa Bay offensive line features some shuffled parts this season, which could require a bit of an adjustment period. The Bears' offense will have to find ways to manufacture touches for its two talented backs, as it did in Week 1.\n\nTom Pennington/Getty Images\n\nIf Ezekiel Elliott doesn't miss time, are the Cowboys now the clear favorite in the NFC East?\n\nGraziano: Nooooo, it's way too soon to say that. A week ago, I think we all expected the Giants to be a good team, and it would be wrong to let one game change that expectation. There's a reasonable chance Sunday was the worst game the Giants' offense will play all season, and there's a nonzero chance it's the best game the Cowboys' defense will play all season. I expect the NFC East to be a close race. I expect the tougher schedules to make it difficult for the teams at the top to win the 13 and 11 games they won a year ago. I'm not ruling out Philadelphia and Washington as troublemakers or even contenders, assuming the division tightens up as I expect it to. Long way to go in the NFC East.\n\nSando: I'm not throwing everything out the window after one game. The Giants were my pick heading into the season, with Dallas right there in the mix and Philadelphia as a team with boom-or-bust potential. Odell Beckham Jr.'s health is such a key variable.\n\nSchatz: Yes. The NFC East is strong from top to bottom, but the Cowboys were the best team in the division in 2016 and look like the best team this year now that Elliott is expected to play the whole season. If Jaylon Smith and Taco Charlton can help make the defense even just a little bit above average, Dallas is an even better bet to repeat as division champion. That's tough for the other three teams, each of which might be the favorite if it played in the AFC South.\n\nSeifert: Yes. I didn't think the Giants had done enough to catch up with them during the offseason, and nothing that happened Sunday night changed my mind. There is no way that one non-quarterback, be it OBJ or anyone else, can make that big of a difference. The Eagles are intriguing as Carson Wentz develops, but the Cowboys look stronger once again.\n\nYates: The clear favorite? No. The favorite? Yes. Dallas taking care of business at home in Week 1 was critical, but let's not get too far ahead of ourselves. The defense will be tested far more in future weeks, as the Giants' offense sputtered in the opener minus Beckham.\n\nWho's the player you're picking up for your fantasy team this week?\n\nGraziano: Tarik Cohen, RB, Bears. (Though, not to brag, I did pick him up in a sneaky Saturday night move in one league last week.) One person in the Bears organization told me a few weeks ago, \"He's this year's Tyreek Hill.\" Chicago wants to use Cohen in a variety of roles, and I think you saw a little bit of that Sunday. Some concern about whether he can hold up at 5-foot-6 -- yes, I'll field trade offers this week! -- but if he's on the field, he's going to get the ball. Honorable mention for me is Nelson Agholor, who I think is a real part of the plans in Philadelphia.\n\nGet the best of ESPN sent to your inbox ESPN Daily delivers the biggest sports news and moments every weekday. Sign me up! Email:\n\nSando: You want the truth? I'm in the kicker market after drafting Sebastian Janikowski and then forgetting to make the change while I was traveling to Green Bay for the Seahawks-Packers game. I went into Monday night tied after getting no points from the kicker spot. Once I get a kicker, I'm monitoring Saints receivers Tommylee Lewis and Brandon Coleman, who have a chance to put up some numbers in that offense.\n\nSchatz: Don't overreact to big Week 1 games by lesser-known players. Beware the Ides of Ogletree, and Escape the Fate of Frisman Jackson. Instead, react to injuries: Jacksonville wants a run-heavy offense, but the Jaguars still have to pass the ball sometimes, and Marqise Lee is now the clear No. 1 receiver with Allen Robinson out for the season.\n\nSeifert: Cohen. I expected him to be a special-teams contributor and possible change-of-pace back for the Bears right away. But I did not think he would get as much work in their passing game, split outside as a receiver and running sophisticated routes. But with the losses of Cam Meredith and Kevin White, who else is Mike Glennon going to throw to?\n\nYates: It's all about Lions rookie Kenny Golladay. The talented third-round pick won't likely repeat his two-touchdown effort against the Giants in Week 2, but it's clear he's going to push for more playing time after logging 62 percent of the snaps in Week 1. He could eventually surpass Marvin Jones for the No. 2 receiver gig in Detroit.\n\nDavid Johnson could miss three months after having surgery on his dislocated wrist. AP Photo/Jose Juarez\n\nWhich potential playoff contender is in the most trouble after a Week 1 loss: Giants, Cardinals, Titans, Bengals or Texans?\n\nGraziano: Cardinals all day. David Johnson is the offense, and they're in huge trouble while he's out. This was already a team on a tightrope -- an aging roster built to win now with little depth at key positions like QB and WR. The Johnson injury is the most significant thing that happened to any contender this week, by far.\n\nSando: The Texans are in the most trouble based on their short-term quarterback situation, but there's still a chance the AFC South will bail them out.\n\nSchatz: A lot of teams had offensive line problems this week, but the Bengals can't count on defense like the Giants can, and they can't get their best lineman back from a holdout like the Texans can. All those great skill players might not be very useful if the line can't block and Andy Dalton can't get them the ball.\n\nSeifert: Arizona. I thought before the season began that it looked like an old team with a rapidly closing window. Quarterback Carson Palmer looked old in Week 1 against the Lions, and the Johnson injury robs the Cardinals of the player best suited to carry their offense.\n\nYates: The Cardinals because of the injury to Johnson. He's not just the focal point of their offense -- he's their franchise centerpiece.\n\nWho's your pick to be a fantasy flop this week?\n\nGraziano: Mike Evans, WR, Bucs. I love Evans this season, but this Pro Football Focus item showed how great the Bears were against opposing No. 1 wide receivers last year -- that they play a ton of Cover 6 and manage to take away the opposing team's No. 1. And then Julio Jones had 66 yards on four catches against them Sunday. That doesn't mean you can't throw on them, just that this has a little bit of a chance to be a DeSean Jackson game with the better Evans games to come later.\n\nSando: Le'Veon Bell, RB, Steelers. He could face tough sledding again as he draws the Minnesota defense in Week 2, although the Vikings will be coming off a short week.\n\nSchatz: T.Y. Hilton, WR, Colts. Going against Patrick Peterson, with either a terrible quarterback (Scott Tolzien) or one who has been in the offensive scheme for less than three weeks (Jacoby Brissett)? No, thanks.\n\nSeifert: Carson Wentz, QB, Eagles. After seeing what the Chiefs did to Tom Brady and the Patriots last week, I don't like Wentz's chances of putting up big numbers in Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nYates: Dez Bryant, WR, Cowboys. After a slow start in Week 1, I think he is in for another quiet Sunday against the lockdown Denver defense. He managed just two catches on nine targets in Week 1. Bryant is still working to find a rhythm with Dak Prescott.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-13T12:20:00.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0913%2Fr257369_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"ZaGUubeSM9Ju2sK8kiGflQ==\n"}

We’ll all float in this informative look at the ultimate Stephen King villain. We’ll all float in this informative look at the ultimate Stephen King villain.\n\nIt’s back! That creepy clown Pennywise is back -- and on the big screen no less -- after his debut in the 1986 Stephen King novel, It, and the 1990 TV adaptation of the same story. Pennywise looms large in the horror pantheon and inspires a lot of thought; there’s even one of those Internet “fan theories” (ugh) that suggests Pennywise is the same entity that appears as Killer Bob in Twin Peaks!\n\nBut we’re not here to indulge that kind of silliness; we’re here to explore just what Pennywise is, and what we might see him do in the feature film. So, let’s get going down into the sewers; after all, we all float down there…\n\nIt (1990) It (2017) 01 of 12 Pennywise the Clown has gotten a big makeover for the new movie, with a more overtly scary, court jester look.\n\nCheck out our comparison between the miniseries version of It and the new movie version above.\n\nThe Basics\n\nPennywise – or “It,” if you prefer, or “Pennywise the Dancing Clown” if you’d like to be very formal – is an all-encompassing evil being of varying shape and size (more on that later) that turns up in 27-year cycles (give or take) in the beleaguered town of Derry, Maine. His principal purpose is to murder children, and what better way to achieve that end than to most often take on the guise of a delightful clown? Because kids just love clowns! I know I do; don’t you? Seriously, who ever thought that clowns weren’t the embodiment of all that is unholy and evil? Come on now! Ringling Bros. and Barnum \u0026 Bailey has a lot to answer for…\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nIt’s (Haha, this is grammatically correct here, think about it!) primary power is the ability to transform into just about anything, thus taking on the image of whatever its current victim fears, whether an animal or something more fanciful and bizarre. By instilling fear, it primes its prey for the final moment of death, and then it feeds. It also has the ability to influence memory and action, covering up and erasing the knowledge of past violent acts that would have revealed its presence and its reign of death; in particular, it cloaks itself well from the perception of adult human beings. In its most original form as the Deadlights (we’ll get there), it can drive those that see It insane or at least catatonic, which only makes it that much clearer that King’s conception of this shapeless creature was inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft. After all, if space has a color, then surely evil has a shape…\n\nOrigin and Background\n\nWhere does evil truly come from? In the case of It, this thing existed before the universe in which we now live, a being from the dawn of time and a reality beyond our own, along with its enemy “The Turtle” or “Maturin.” Plummeting to Earth from the Macroverse (which may be the “Todash Darkness” of King’s Dark Tower cycle) as a celestial body, the creature slept under the lands that would one day be Derry, Maine, and there it waited until human beings arrived to provide it with sustenance. After its first feeding, it began to cycle in and out of three decade-long slumbers, staying conscious for two years as it stalked prey, taunting them by metamorphosing into what its victims feared the most, and then feasting after it had “salted the meat” with their own terror. While it fed on any human, children were more easily frightened and their fears more simply represented, so it ultimately settled on a youthful diet.\n\nSpeaking of Maturin, if you really want to delve into King cosmology, check out the aforementioned Dark Tower series, where you’ll learn more about the role of the Turtle and It, their creation by “The Other,” and their eternal struggle as representatives of universal opposing forces. A creature of many shapes can also have many names, and “It” is no different, even if we most often know It as Pennywise the Dancing Clown (a form partially inspired by pop culture clowns like Clarabell and Bozo, as well as McDonald’s red-haired maniac Ronald). Its familiar and equally chilling form of a Giant Spider and its original existence as the orange Deadlights add to the list, as does its guises as the Leper, Mrs. Kersh, and Mr. Robert “Bob” Gray. The 2017 film will add two new identities for It: Headless Boy and Judith. The actual gender of the creature is indeterminate and may not be relevant at all. To defeat it, you might have to conduct the “Ritual of Chüd.”\n\nBeyond the Book\n\nOf course, Tim Curry is Pennywise for a generation of television viewers. He played the role in the 1990 TV miniseries adaptation of the novel, and the man that made The Rocky Horror Picture Show’s Frank N. Furter a pop culture icon was quite capable of doing just the same with one of the scariest clowns every conceived. His rough-voiced approach to the character belied his twinkle-eyed appearance, and with jagged teeth bared, you could believe this guy could rip you to pieces; Hell, I’d believe that of Curry with no makeup at all!\n\nNow we’ll have to see what Bill Skarsgård will bring to the ring as he takes on the role in the new 2017 film production; according to many who've seen the film already, it seems he’ll also scare the pants off us just as easily, if not more so! He’s joined by actors playing other forms of the creature, including Javier Botet as the Leper, Carter Musselman as the Headless Boy, and Tatum Lee as Judith. Now it’s time to go try out that newspaper sailboat!\n\nFind Arnold T. Blumberg on Twitter at @DoctoroftheDead.","author":"Arnold T.

You will find yourself traveling down platforms flanked by rows of Cabal Legionaries - you do not have to engage with these enemies, and they will not attack unless provoked.\n\nClimb the ramps to the top of the embankment's entryway, then use the launchers to proceed to the large doorway at the top of the Embankment and make your way through the winding halls into the Castellum.\n\nEditThe Castellum: Standard Bearers Challenge\n\n\n\nUpon entering the Castellum you'll encounter your first batch of hostile enemies. Dispose of them if you wish, but they'll only be replaced by more soldiers.\n\nThis area has your first group challenge - as you enter the Castellum, head around the left side of the large central structure and up the steps towards the locked door. You'll notice a seal on the floor near the door that has a transluscent sun insignia floating above it.\n\nWhen you first reach the seal, you will see one of three symbols replace the sun insignia. Each floating icon corresponds to a banner that must be claimed from a nearby spawn. The best way to accomplish this challenge is to split into two teams, either 3 \u0026 3 or 2 \u0026 4.\n\nOne of the teams should remain at the seal and one should work to claim the banners as quickly as possible.

The War Beast: This banner spawns on the opposite side of the large central structure within the Castellum, across from the seal.\n\nOnce the first banner is identified, the collecting Guardians should head to that location and proceed to kill enemies until an elite Standard Bearer appears. When this enemy has been defeated, one Guardian may claim the banner and the team should escort them back to the seal to set it in place.\n\nThe \"base\" team, those Guardians who remain at the seal to defend it, must then prevent Standard Liberators from reclaiming the banners. In order to break their impenetrable shield, however, you must identify and eliminate the Councilor who spawns alongside the Liberatior.\n\nWARNING: If a Standard Liberator makes it onto the seal and reclaims a banner, the entire challenge must be restarted and all the previously collected banners will be reset.\n\n\n\nRetrieve and place all three banners to complete the challenge, unlock the door and move on. In the exit hall you will find your first Raid Chest.\n\nEditThe Royal Pools\n\n\n\nThis next chamber is divided into two sections - one right as you enter with two platforms on either side of the central pathway with large winches in them, and another up a short flight of stairs that opens into a large pool full of viscous liquid with a platform in the center and two more pools with winches on either side of that.\n\nEach of the four pools has a platform with a glowing orb on it, with one in the center of the middle pool as well. Between the six members of your fire team, you’ll need to ensure that the four platforms in the side pools consistently have someone standing on them. When the four platforms are simultaneously occupied, the event will begin and enemies will begin to spawn, including several Royal Bathers who arrive from below the winch chains. These enemies are similar to the Cabal Gladiators, but with substantially more health.\n\nNOTE: Each platform comes with an Psionic Protection buff for it’s incoming recipient to help them avoid taking damage from the liquid in the pools. However, the buff only lasts for 50 seconds while you're standing on a platform, so players must either quickly leave their platform to collect the recurring Psionic Protection pickup in the central pool or must be replaced on that platform by another player.\n\n\n\nIt’s recommended that you develop a rotational pattern whereby two Guardians are always roaming the area dealing with enemies and replacing players whose buffs are about to expire. After ~ two to three minutes, three sets of three large lanterns will descend into the main pool chamber.\n\nStand on the platform and fire at them with everything you’ve got to destroy them before they rescind into the ceiling and force you to restart the event. Destroy all nine lanterns to complete the challenge, claim your rewards and proceed to the next area.\n\nEditThe Castellum (Return)\n\nAfter completing the challenge in the Royal Pools, return to the Castellum to find the door you need to access in the back-right corner of the area.\n\nYou’ll need to once again complete the Banner event, with one team eliminating enemies and Standard Bearers and another protecting the door seal from Standard Liberators. Collect all three banners to advance to the Pleasure Gardens.\n\nEditPleasure Gardens\n\n\n\nThe Pleasure Gardens is the next chamber of the raid. This chamber is a circular room covered in a lush jungle environment. When you first start this encounter, there will be a couple Cabal soldiers and War Beasts that you must eliminate before being able to move on. Once these enemies are defeated, two crystal prisms will spawn on a platform at the back of the room.\n\nNOTE: Picking up both these crystals will start the main Pleasure Gardens encounter! It is highly recommended to look around and memorize the layout of the room before starting the main encounter.\n\n\n\nThis encounter’s main objective is to kill the 6 Royal Beasts in the room. This encounter will split your fireteam into two teams: 4 Pollen holders and 2 Crystal holders. Under the platform where the two crystals spawn is a safe room which also spawns 4 pollen orbs. Players must take all 4 of these pollen balls to one of 8 large pollen spores on the map without being seen by the prowling Royal Beasts. The Royal Beasts slowly walk around the room with with the same route every time. Stay out of their cone of vision and you should be fine. There are 3 large pollen spores on the right and left sides of the room and two near the center of the room. Pollen bearers will know which large pollen spore to go to because of the bright purple aura surrounding it.\n\nNot all of the large pollen spores will have this purple aura and they will be random. The crystal bearers must hop around above the jungle and scout for the pollen bearers. Once all 4 pollen bearers are at an activated pollen spore, a crystal bearer must shoot and explode the large pollen spore. Crystal bearers must be standing in a pillar of light in order to shoot with the crystal.\n\nIf all 4 pollen bearers were close enough to the exploded pollen spore then players should see a “Empowering Spores x12” buff at the bottom left of the screen. Move around the room to the next activated spore and repeat this process to receive more damage buffs. Once enough time has passed or a player becomes spotted by a Royal Beast, the damage phase will begin. The Royal Beasts will always return to a large pollen spore during this damage phase so it will be easy to track them. Do NOT kill these beasts during the damage phase, only weaken them. Killing a Royal Beast drastically reduces the time you have during the next cycle. Once the damage phase starts, players have about 20-25 seconds before returning to the safe room under the crystal spawns. Repeat this process until you have all the Royal Beasts weak enough to kill in one damage phase.\n\nNOTE: Players only get a total of 4 damage phases before the safe room becomes sealed permanently.\n\n\n\nHigh pulse damage output weapons are recommended here. Shotguns, Fusion Rifles, and Hunter Golden Gun + Celestial Nighthawks are solid choices to damage the Royal Beasts quickly.\n\nEditThe Castellum (3)\n\nAfter completing the challenge in the Pleasure Gardens, return to the Castellum to find the door you need to access near the middle of the area. You’ll need to once again complete the Banner event, with one team eliminating enemies and Standard Bearers and another protecting the door seal from Standard Liberators. Collect all three banners to advance to the Gauntlet.\n\nEditThe Gauntlet\n\n\n\nThe Gauntlet is the last chamber players must conquer before the boss. The Gauntlet chamber is a circular room with an outer ring surrounding the room. The chamber has 4 large pillars made up of 3 arrows. Stand on the platform in front of these pillars to start this encounter.\n\nOnce the encounter begins, Cabal soldiers will start to pour out into the room. Fight these soldiers until a large Centurion spawns. Kill the Centurion and two psionic charges will spawn on opposite ends of the room. Have the two people that are not in front of the pillars pick up the psion charges. These two players will then be transported to the outer ring of the Gauntlet.\n\nThe runners must run clockwise and run toward the arrow pillars. The runners will see a circle that is lit up in red and must tell the person outside the pillar which row the lit up circle is in: Top, Middle, Bottom. If the lit circle is in the top row, two of the four players inside must shoot at the middle and bottom arrows of that pillar at the same time. If the lit circle is in the middle row, shoot the top and bottom arrows and so on so forth. If you do this correctly, the arrows will light up green and allow the psion charge runner to continue. After the runner passes a pillar, a Councilor will appear in front of that pillar. Kill the Councilor quickly to keep the encounter going.\n\nRepeat this entire process successfully twice and 6 psion charges will spawn in the center of the room, one for each player. Picking up these charges will teleport all 6 players to the outer ring where they must run clockwise around the rings.\n\nThere will be additional psion charges you can run through to prevent yourself from blowing up. Once this is complete, head back to the Castellum.\n\nEditThe Castellum\n\nAfter completing The Gauntlet, return once again to the Castellum to find the last door you need to access. You’ll need to once again complete the Banner event, with one team eliminating enemies and Standard Bearers and another protecting the door seal from Standard Liberators. Collect all three banners to advance to Calus.\n\nEditFinal Boss: Emperor Calus\n\n\n\nCalus, the Cabal Emperor, is the boss for the Leviathan. Shooting the cup out of his hand will start this encounter. Calus’ main attack is a laser beam he shoots out of his forehead. Stay out of his line of sight to avoid the laser beam attack. Once the encounter starts, kill all the Cabal enemies in order to get Calus to summon four Councilors. These Councilors will have different symbols above their heads: Chalice, Swords, Beast, Sun. Memorizing where these symbols are will be key in beating Calus.\n\nOnce Councilors spawn, Calus will teleport you to an alternate dimension. There will be three psion charges in front of you, determine which three players take these charges to teleport back into Calus’ room. The players that remain in the alternate universe will each see a different Councilor symbol on Calus’ forehead. It is vital that these players relay which symbols they see to the three players inside Calus’ room. The symbol that is not called out will be the Councilor that needs to be kill inside the throne room. Doing this successfully will form a wall inside the alternate dimension, preventing the players from getting sucked into Calus’s mouth. Repeat this call-out process 4 times successfully and the alternate dimension Calus will begin to shoot out skulls from his mouth. Killing these skulls will provide a Force of Will damage buff that is vital to kill Calus.\n\nAs this is going on, the players inside Calus’s throne room must shoot at Calus to stop him from finishing a huge solar attack. Once these two portions are complete, all 6 players will be back in the throne room. The platforms that the Councilors used to be now be lit up. Step on these platforms in order to do DPS to Calus. It is recommended that everyone jumps on the same platform and rotate accordingly. Repeat this entire process until Calus has no health. Once Calus loses all of his health, he will start a massive solar attack. Keep shooting at him until he finally dies. Calus has a lot of health during this last part so give him all you got.\n\nMore information will be added soon!\n\nWant to update this page even before we can?\n\nHit the edit button in the top-left corner of the page!\n\n","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T04:43:28.000Z"},"source":"ign","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/05/27/contentplaceholderpng-967b4c.png","digest":"6D/wrAgld5BejIBHpj+ssg==\n"}

Column: The Force Awakens director is going back to that galaxy far, far away... and we see both pros and cons to the situation.\n\nJ.J. Abrams, who of course reignited the big screen Star Wars franchise in 2015 with The Force Awakens, has now been confirmed to be returning to the series as the director and co-writer of Star Wars: Episode IX. He'll be replacing the recently departed Colin Trevorrow (Jurassic World).\n\nWhile Abrams represents a tried and true helmer who should bring a stabilizing presence to the final installment in the new trilogy (the second film in that arc, The Last Jedi, will be released this December and was directed by Rian Johnson), not everyone sees the filmmaker as the magic bullet who will solve all of Star Wars problems. Meanwhile others don't see Star Wars as having too many problems at all! With that in mind, I got together with IGN's Jim Vejvoda and Joshua Yehl to break down the two sides of the argument below. Consider this the pros and cons of J.J.

Abrams is a producer, writer and director with plenty of Hollywood tentpole street cred. Aside from already reviving Star Wars with The Force Awakens two years ago -- the film made over $2 billion in box office -- Abrams brought Paramount's Star Trek back to the big screen before that. He's also had a ton of other successes on the small screen as well, and he's the ultimate go-to-guy in town who doesn't just have a vision as a writer-director but can also make things happen as a producer.\n\nAs he's proven time and again, he isn't just able to navigate the pipeline of a project this big, from script to production to marketing -- which he is known for having a big hand in as well -- but he's also able to play the political side of things, which is perhaps as important as any inherent creative talent he may have when dealing with a studio.\n\nThat's surely why Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has returned to Abrams now to complete the trilogy, after several misadventures with younger directors on the new crop of Star Wars movies.\n\nPlus, of course, he was the key creator of our new favorite characters -- Rey, Finn, Kylo Ren, Poe Dameron, and BB-8! He took the classic Star Wars cast and brought them back as George Lucas has promised he would do all those years ago to complete their story. If The Force Awakens had been a failure, we'd probably be looking at a very different Star Wars movie scenario right now rather than the Golden Age of yearly films that we're getting.\n\nBut perhaps most importantly, Abrams is a fan himself. He's often said it himself: Star Wars was his thing growing up, and you can tell it's true when watching The Force Awakens (even if, yes, that sometimes means the film hews a little too closely to the original Lucas movie). Who better to close out the tale of the Skywalker saga?\n\nThe Dark Side\n\nHere’s the thing about J.J. Abrams returning to write and co-direct Star Wars: Episode IX: It’s the kind of thinking that will prevent Star Wars from ever being truly great again.\n\nSure, The Force Awakens fine. But all the things fans complain about when talking about that film – the copycat-itis of it all – represent a trait that Abrams has exhibited in his movies before, and it’s what will ultimately make Episode IX a safe bet that will make loads of money for Kathleen Kennedy but not necessarily take the series to new heights.\n\nIn his too-eager-to-please-the-crowds mindset, Abrams resorts to what you could call the meme-ification of his subject matter. Star Trek Into Darkness is the worst example of this, where only two movies into the rebooting/rethinking of that series, he was already going to the Khan well. Of the vast universe of possible original concepts and ideas that Star Trek could explore, Abrams couldn’t help himself and had to adapt its most popular and identifiable storyline. And within his film, he unleashed awful spins on iconic moments and lines from the original Wrath of Khan, whether it was Zachary Quinto screaming “KHAAAAN” – instead of Kirk this time! – or Chris Pine dying in the engine room – instead of Spock! You see that same trend in Force Awakens’ aping of A New Hope, though in a less crass way, perhaps because Abrams has always been a self-professed Star Wars fan rather a Trekkie. All of this has happened before...\n\nKathleen Kennedy’s original impulse to hire fresh young talent to make Star Wars has obviously backfired, and certainly she has had a hugely successful and long career in Hollywood and knows what she's doing. But the bottom line is, Star Wars used to be the brainchild of one guy: George Lucas. Like it or not, he owned it and he was in charge of it, prequels and all, until he sold Lucasfilm to Disney. It was his overall, guiding hand and his vision behind the series from day one. Essentially, it was the most expensive and longest-running independent film project. But the day Disney acquired the thing, it became corporate. And corporate don’t play, especially with hotshot young directors who want to take risks with beloved – and lucrative – IPs.\n\nAnd so that brings us back to Abrams, who knows how to make a movie of this size within the system. Abrams is a visually talented, slick filmmaker, a P. T. Barnum for the multiplex who will make Disney a ton of money with Episode IX. And there's no doubt the resulting film will be entertaining and hit all the beats that a modern Star Wars movie is expected to hit. But there was a time not that long ago when Star Wars seemed like it could truly grow and evolve into something more; now it’s clear that was a foolish belief to have. There’s just too much at stake now for Kennedy and the studio.\n\nStar Wars: Episode IX will now be released on December 20, 2019, Lucasfilm announced today.\n\nTalk to Senior Editor Scott Collura on Twitter at @ScottCollura.","author":"Scott Collura","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-12T22:45:29.000Z"},"source":"ign","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/05/27/lightsabersjpg-b61171_1280w.jpg","digest":"eIzdBHmqKoAOLBgFITV1dw==\n"}

He also echoed the studio's prior claims that Sledgehammer is aiming to make this the scariest Zombies mode yet.\n\n\"The approach is, of course, rooted in [the studio’s] horror background, so it was a lot of fun to develop this new experience. Our goal was to make this the most terrifying Zombies experience we’ve ever created,\" Horsley said. For those who don't know, the founding members of Sledgehammer were behind Visceral Games' horror game Dead Space.\n\nHorsley also offered a few details about the setting and plot, confirming the mode will be set in a Bavarian village in Germany towards the end of WWII. Players can explore sewers, laboratories and tombs in this area, as different types of enemies like flaming and running zombies will create greater challenges. The environments aren't just for show either, with Horsley noting that some structures and machines, such as the saw blades seen in the reveal trailer, can be used against enemies.\n\nHorsley also noted that both inexperienced players and veterans will be able to enjoy Zombies, with new players being guided into the game, and plenty of \"new challenges and additional layers of gameplay\" for hardcore players. Additionally, he confirmed that temporary and permanent upgrades will come to play, but remained tight-lipped about specifics.\n\nFor more on Activision's upcoming shooter, check out this special camo-colored PS4 bundle, which will be released alongside Call of Duty: WWII on November 3.\n\nHope Corrigan is an Australian freelancer for IGN.

It looks a lot like the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, but with a glass back. The iPhone 8 still has a single camera while the 8 Plus has a double camera.\n\nIt comes in silver, space gray and a new gold finish that looks like a mix between gold and rose gold. These phones are sealed to be water and dust resistant. Apple also announced the iPhone X at the same conference, a new, premium model with a screen that fills the front of the device. Read more in our separate post.\n\nThere’s a new retina HD display. It has true tone technology like the most recent iPad Pro. It adapts to ambient light. Speakers are 25 percent louder and have deeper bass. Inside, it has an A11 Bionic chip. It is a 64-bit chip with two high-performance cores that are 25 percent faster than the A10 in the iPhone 7, and 4 high-efficiency cores that are 70 percent faster than the ones in the A10 (the A10 only had two high-efficiency cores). The GPU part is 30 percent faster.\n\n3Q3A0550 3Q3A0565 3Q3A0570 3Q3A0573 Apple A11 Bionic View Slideshow Previous Next Exit\n\nThe camera sensor and processor are brand new. It works better in low light condition, and has some noise reduction technology. The two sensors on the back of the iPhone 8 Plus are f1.8 and f2.8 apertures — it is brighter than the iPhone 7 Plus. There are new color filters too, which should make colors pop more, according to SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller.\n\nApple then explained portait mode. It detects depth so that it can intelligently change the lighting effect on your face independently of the background. When it comes to video, it supports faster frame rates. You can expect 4K videos at 60 frames per second. For slo-mo videos, your 1080 videos will have 240 frames per second. So it should be even slower motion.\n\nThese cameras and the A11 Bionic chip have been calibrated for augmented reality. Schiller demoed the MLB At Bat app. Now, you can point your phone at the field and it’ll tell you who’s playing right now in front of you. Directive Games showed a demo of a tabletop game that takes advantage of ARKit. You can move your phone around to see the game unfolding on the table in front of you. It looks quite convincing, but it’s unclear if game developers are going to take advantage of ARKit or if it’s going to end up being a gimmick like the Wiimote.\n\nThe iPhone 8, just like many Android phones out there, now supports wireless charging. It should work with many third-party wireless chargers as Apple is using a common standard.\n\nThe iPhone 8 is going to start at $699 for 64GB. The iPhone 8 Plus is going to cost $799 and more.

On occasion, a comment will seem so misogynistic that I feel compelled to say something.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat happened this past week when a conversation about my friend Armie Hammer’s forthcoming film — in which a 24-year-old and 17-year-old have a relationship — escalated, as things can on Twitter, I guess, into a discussion with the actor James Woods about what is appropriate behavior in terms of an adult dating someone underage. Mr. Woods spoke critically, if flippantly, of the story depicted in the film. Mr. Woods has been known to date much younger women, so Armie pointed out the hypocrisy.\n\nIn an instant, I was reminded of a memory from when I was 16. Mr. Woods attempted to pick me and a friend up when we were at Mel’s diner in Hollywood, seeing if we wanted to go to Las Vegas with him that very night. I informed him of my age, to which he said, “Even better.” I told this story publicly as a way to back up the claim that Mr. Woods was, indeed, a hypocrite. Mr. Woods called my account a lie.\n\nWhat would I get out of accusing this person of such an action, almost 20 years after the fact? Notoriety, power or respect?

Bannon has ties to a group taking on the establishment favorite in the U.S. Senate race in Alabama. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nIf “war” against the Republican establishment is what former White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon wants, then war is what he will get.\n\nDeep-pocketed supporters of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and other GOP leaders have resolved to fight a protracted battle over the next year for the soul of the party in congressional primaries. “It’s shaping up to be McConnell, the Senate Leadership Fund and the Chamber against Bannon,” said Scott Reed, the senior political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “And we will take that fight.”\n\nBut the task will not be easy. Strategists from both sides of the party’s divide say recent focus groups and polling have shown that the frustration within the Republican base has only grown since the 2016 election, stoked by an inability to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s health-care law. President Trump, meanwhile, has continued to cast his presidency in opposition to the current ways of Washington, which could encourage primary voters to buck the system in a way that endangers House and Senate incumbents.\n\n“Just as in 2008, the election did little to let the air out of the tires,” said Steven Law, the president of the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC allied with McConnell that plans to spend heavily on Senate primaries in support of incumbents. “The raw material of the electorate is just increasingly volatile.”\n\nThe first battle will conclude this month in Alabama, where the incumbent senator — establishment-backed Luther Strange — is fighting uphill against former state Supreme Court judge Roy Moore, a conservative evangelical jurist who has twice been removed from the bench for defying legal decisions. Known for his conviction that Christian teachings are the source of all government authority, Moore has twice been elected statewide to the Supreme Court, but he also lost two primary campaigns for governor, in 2006 and 2010. He bested Strange by a margin of 39 percent to 33 percent in the first round of Senate primary voting last month.\n\nRep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), who came in third in the first round of primary voting, threw his support behind Moore at a rally Saturday. “It is truly amazing the audacity, the ego of the special-interest groups and the political action committees as they try to buy this United States Senate race thinking that with impunity they can run over the people of the state of Alabama,” Brooks declared.\n\nIn a sign of fights to come, the two Republican candidates are now competing to demonstrate their disgust with Washington politics. Strange, who was appointed this year to take the seat of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, begins one of his most recent television ads looking at the camera and announcing that he is “mad at Washington politicians.”\n\nMoore describes his campaign as an effort to hurt McConnell, drain the swamp and bring more radical policies to the Senate, including a possible effort to impeach sitting U.S. Supreme Court justices for affirming the constitutionality of same-sex marriages.\n\nAlthough Trump has endorsed Strange, Bannon is backing Moore — and using the conservative website he runs, Breitbart News, to hammer the incumbent as a “swamp monster.”\n\nAllies of McConnell have been blanketing the Alabama airwaves to shrink Moore’s polling lead. After spending nearly $4 million on ads before the first primary vote in August, the Senate Leadership Fund plans to blitz the state with another $4 million before the Sept. 26 runoff. So far this year, the super PAC has raised more than $11 million, including a $1 million infusion from hedge fund manager Paul Singer last month, federal filings show.\n\nThe Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee have also sunk money into the race to defend Strange. The Business Council of Alabama, working with the U.S. Chamber, plans a major employee get-out-the-vote operation to support Strange by arguing that he will be better for the state’s industry and jobs. The chamber has also paid for a statewide mailer and an ad campaign that will include a spot during Saturday’s Alabama and Auburn college football games. “There is no taking it back,” Reed said. “Alabama is the big enchilada.”\n\nThe Senate Leadership Fund is also taking aim at Bannon himself in an effort to tarnish his position as a champion of the Trump political movement. Law released a statement on Tuesday calling Bannon “dead wrong” for using a recent “60 Minutes” interview to criticize Trump’s decision to fire former FBI director James B. Comey.\n\nFormer White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon gave a wide-ranging interview to “60 Minutes.” Here’s what he said about Republican leadership and the Russia investigation. (Amber Ferguson,Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nAt the Chamber, Reed echoed the criticism of Bannon for breaking with Trump. “He is turning into a rallying point for the alt-right, which is kind of bizarre because half of what he does is damage his former client and friend, whom he served as chief strategist for,” Reed said.\n\nBannon declined to comment. But a person familiar with his thinking described the pushback by McConnell allies as “the corrupt and incompetent political class” taking on Trump’s base.\n\n[Bannon’s ‘epic’ defense of Trump doesn’t extend to all his moves, or all his aides and allies]\n\nBannon’s allies scoffed at the notion that the McConnell-allied groups could drive a wedge between Trump’s supporters and Bannon. “At the end of the day, folks like that think the president’s base is stupid,” said a person close to the conservative media executive. “It shows the arrogance of the Republican political class in Washington.”\n\nTo counter the onslaught against Moore, the conservative advocacy group Great America Alliance, which is now overseen by Bannon protege and former deputy White House political director Andy Surabian, released a digital ad Tuesday featuring a montage of grainy photos of McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) that argues over a rock-n-roll score that Strange was “appointed by the swamp.”\n\nThe group and its allies do not intend to match the volume of anti-Moore ads on television, but there are plans for a bus tour of the state by conservative activists in the next couple of weeks to support the Moore campaign, culminating in a major rally before the election. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who has endorsed Moore, is expected to travel to Alabama to appear as part of the tour.\n\nAnd Moore allies have hope that their side will see an infusion of big money, too. Great America and its sister super PAC have new links to Bannon and his political patrons, the wealthy Mercer family. The former White House strategist does not have a formal role with the organizations, but he helped install Surabian as the top strategist at the advocacy group, according to a person familiar with his role.\n\nEd Rollins, the veteran GOP strategist who leads Great America PAC, said he has recently “exchanged some ideas” with Bannon, for whom he said he has “great respect.” And he has also been in talks with the Mercers, influential but idiosyncratic donors who often buck the GOP party establishment.\n\n“We are having discussions but no formal ties at this point,” Rollins said of the family. “The more we can get going in the same direction, the better. We certainly have had some conversations.”\n\nIf they decide to put serious sums into groups taking on establishment candidates, hedge fund magnate Robert Mercer and his middle daughter, Rebekah, could help fuel the GOP’s latest internecine battles. Before supporting Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign, they gave $13.5 million to a super PAC that backed Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Trump’s longest-lasting challenger for the nomination.\n\n[The rise of GOP mega-donor Rebekah Mercer]\n\nA spokeswoman for the Mercer family did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut there are already indications the Mercers plan to use their money to take on GOP incumbents this cycle. In late July, Robert Mercer gave $300,000 to a super PAC allied with former Arizona state senator Kelli Ward, who is challenging Republican Sen. Jeff Flake in the state’s primary, federal filings show.\n\nMercer also contributed $50,000 this summer to a new super PAC, Remember Mississippi, set up by an aide to state Sen. Chris McDaniel, who is considering challenging GOP incumbent Sen. Roger Wicker in the state.\n\nMeanwhile, the pro-Trump super PAC America First and its sister advocacy group — which have emerged as the president’s officially approved outside groups — have largely stayed out of the intraparty fights. Since making a small digital ad buy for Strange in early August, before the first round of voting in the Alabama special election, the PAC has not invested any money in the contest.\n\nTrump’s own apparent ambivalence over the Alabama race hints at the complicating factor he is likely to play in the coming fights. Although he endorsed Strange, he has not yet cut any political advertisements.\n\nAfter the first round of primary elections, he tweeted congratulations to both men who made it through to the runoff, notably listing Moore’s name first. “Congratulation to Roy Moore and Luther Strange,” the tweet said, adding, “Exciting race!”\n\nWhite House legislative director Marc Short said this week that Trump “continues to stand by” his Strange endorsement. Trump announced late Saturday on Twitter that he would visit Huntsville, Ala.. on Saturday to campaign for Strange.\n\nRepublican strategists aiming to defend incumbents say they expect Trump to be an unreliable partner in the coming season. The president tends to approach questions of political loyalty on a case-by-case basis instead of as a party leader. And he is intent on keeping some distance from Republican congressional leadership, which has so far failed to deliver on his promise of Obamacare repeal.\n\nIn many ways, the coming 2018 contests will be a rematch of high-stakes primary fights that have taken place every two years since the 2008 election, when self-branded tea party challengers began trying to unseat incumbent Republicans. Flake and Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), who both face reelection next year, expect populist primary challenges this year. Several primary contests will be for seats with no Republican incumbent, such as those in Michigan, Montana and possibly Utah, where party insiders worry that the more anti-establishment candidates could jeopardize Republicans’ general-election hopes.\n\n“2018 is going to be a wave election, and it is going to be an anti-incumbent wave election,” said Eagle Forum Fund President Ed Martin, who has been traveling the country to hold events to pressure moderate Republicans to support the Trump agenda. “Any Republican that is in office as an incumbent is on the line.”\n\nAfter the 2010 and 2012 elections, which saw Republicans lose Senate races in Missouri, Delaware, Indiana, Colorado and Nevada with tea party candidates, both the Chamber and McConnell decided to be more aggressive in Senate primaries. Since then, the insider powers have tended to have the upper hand, winning the Senate elections they have contested in the primary. McConnell himself survived a tough tea party challenge in 2014, and a huge influx of television spending helped Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) hold off a strong primary challenge that same year.\n\nReed said the Chamber got involved in eight House races and one Senate contest in 2016, and won each. He expects to outperform expectations again over the coming months.\n\n“I think it’s going to be an epic challenge, and we are seeing it in Alabama to start,” he said. “The polls look bad. We’ve got two weeks. We know what we need to do. That’s why we are in this business.”","author":"Michael Scherer, Matea Gold, Michael Scherer, Matea Gold","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T13:50:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/02/02/National-Politics/Images/Botsford170202Trump11390.JPG?t=20170517","digest":"Mu6ICpCQBJTOpxWo9z/8UQ==\n"}

(Ismail Ferdous for The Washington Post)\n\nThe soldiers arrived in the village in western Burma just after 8 a.m., the villagers said, ready to fight a war.\n\nThey fired shots in the air, and then, the villagers say, turned their guns on fleeing residents, who fell dead or wounded in the monsoon-green rice paddies. The military’s retribution for a Rohingya militant attack on police posts earlier that day had begun.\n\nMohammed Roshid, a rice farmer, heard the gunfire and fled with his wife and children, but his 80-year-old father, who walks with a stick, wasn’t as nimble. Roshid said he saw a soldier grab Yusuf Ali and slit his throat with such ferocity that the old man was nearly decapitated.\n\n“I wanted to go back and save him, but some relatives stopped me because there was so many military,” Roshid, 55, said. “It’s the saddest thing in my life that I could not do anything for my father.”\n\nThe Burmese military’s “clearance operation” in the hamlet of Maung Nu and dozens of other villages populated by Burma’s ethnic Rohingya minority has triggered an exodus of an estimated 400,000 refugees into Bangladesh, an episode the United Nations human rights chief has called “ethnic cleansing.” The tide of refugees is expected to grow in the coming days. The new arrivals — dazed, clutching their belongings, some barefoot in ankle-deep mud — have overflowed an existing camp and put up makeshift shelters. Others simply sit on the roadways, fighting crowds as volunteers on large relief trucks fling down bags of rice or bottles of water.\n\nRights groups say it will take months or years to fully chronicle the devastation the refugees are fleeing. Satellite photos show widespread burning, witnesses recount soldiers killing civilians, and the Burmese government has said that 176 Rohingya villages stand empty. No total death toll is yet available because the area remains sealed by the military.\n\n\n\nNajma Begum and her 1-year-old daughter left their home in Burma after her husband told her to escape. He stayed behind. (Ismail Ferdous for The Washington Post )\n\nNearly a dozen villagers from the Maung Nu hamlet who escaped recounted their last hours in their homes and the long journey that followed. They were interviewed for two days in Kutupalong refugee camp near the Bangladesh border, where they arrived last week. Fortify Rights, a Southeast Asia-focused human rights organization, estimates the death toll in Maung Nu and three nearby villages to be 150.\n\n“I can’t count how many,” said Soe Win, a 10th-grade teacher. “We were all watching what the military did. They slaughtered them one by one. And the blood flowed in the streets.”\n\nThe latest wave of violence began Aug. 25, when an emerging group of Rohingya militants, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, attacked 30 police posts and an army base in Rakhine state, killing 12. The subsequent military crackdown has prompted hundreds of thousands of refugees to leave Buddhist-majority Burma, a Southeast Asian nation until recently ruled by a military junta and where Rohingya have long been denied citizenship and other rights.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee estimates that eventually 500,000 will flee to Bangladesh, half of Burma’s known Rohingya population , most of whom live in troubled Rakhine state. The area has long been riven by tensions between Buddhist villagers and the stateless Rohingya, who have been there for centuries but are considered by the government to be illegal immigrants, “Bengalis” from neighboring Bangladesh.\n\n\n\nAfter crossing the Naf River, Rohingya refugees try to get on a boat leaving Shahporir Island for the Teknaf region of Bangladesh’s mainland. (Ismail Ferdous for The Washington Post)\n\nThe crisis has sparked widespread outcry and condemnation of Burma and its de facto leader, Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. She and her government have said little about the plight of the Rohingya, except to reframe the situation as a national security matter as the new militancy has coalesced. On Monday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, called the exodus “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.”\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Maung Nu, a hamlet of about 750 houses that sits along a narrow stretch of the slow-moving Mayu River, the Rohingya had long lived in relative calm, sipping tea with their Buddhist neighbors, villagers say.\n\nBut their peaceful coexistence ended when Rohingya insurgents launched their attack on police posts. The military crackdown has continued unabated since then, black smoke scudding across the skyline, visible in southern Bangladesh even this past week.\n\nMohammed Showife, 23, an auto mechanic, said that on the first day of the assault, he and his family had just finished their morning prayers and were preparing rice when three soldiers appeared in the yard, announcing their arrival with a strafe of machine-gun fire and telling the family that they had to leave immediately.\n\n“They said, ‘You Bengalis come out from the house. You can go anywhere you want, but you can’t live here,’ ” Showife recalled.\n\nHe and his family members scattered, and he stopped to help his neighbor Mohammed Rafique, 17, whose right hip had been run clean through by a bullet, back to front. They ran through a mob looting homes and soldiers setting fire to other dwellings with shoulder-fired rocket launchers.\n\nMany villagers took refuge in the jungle, where the dense foliage, thick after the monsoon season, provided cover.\n\nOnce there, some of the women sat weeping silently. Other villagers just looked at each other: What would they do now? They tried to attend to Rafique’s wound with boiled water and torn strips of clothing.\n\nThe first night, an uneasy darkness settled in, the sky flickering with fire and shadows. They and the villagers still in the hamlet did not know then that there would be five nights more.\n\n\n\nA makeshift Rohingya refugee camp on the way to Teknaf from Cox’s Bazar. (Ismail Ferdous for The Washington Post)\n\nOn the second day, a businessman hiding in his house got a call from a tall, skinny, army sergeant the villagers all knew and called Bajo, who had often dined in the businessman’s home.\n\nBajo told Mohammed Zubair that the military was going to be requisitioning one of his passenger boats. Given the circumstances, Zubair, 40, felt he had no choice but to give it to them. He sent the boat and its captain to the jetty at the nearby army camp. The officers accepted the keys with a warning for the captain: “You will also be killed.” The captain eventually escaped unharmed and fled with the others.\n\nZubair said he had followed to see what was to become of his vessel. He says he watched in horror as the military began stacking the boat with dead bodies, one after another like lumber, including those of two 13-year-old boys he had known well.\n\n“I fainted from seeing this,” Zubair said. He believes the corpses were dumped in the river.\n\nOn the third day, Rafique’s mother, Khalida Begum, 35, had grown tired of moving from house to house with her four other children, desperate for news of her son. She had raised them on her own on a tailor’s salary after her husband died years ago, so she and the children are unusually close. They managed to make it to the jungle, where she saw Rafique lying motionless beneath a tree.\n\nShe ran to him and joyfully covered his face with kisses, as he emerged from a fevered haze. At first he was so disoriented that he didn’t recognize her. But soon both were crying.\n\nOn the sixth day, the residents of Maung Nu, fearing that the danger was growing, decided as a group to start walking north to the border with Bangladesh.\n\nThey walked for eight days with few provisions, eating banana leaves and drinking water from streams. The children whimpered. Showife carried Rafique on his back, the teen drifting in and out of consciousness. After a while, their legs began to swell.\n\nFinally, they reached a crossing high on a hill marked by a simple pillar that they understood meant they had arrived in Bangladesh. It was 4:30 in the afternoon. It was raining. Before them was a new city of refugees, thousands of temporary tents made from bamboo poles covered in black plastic sheeting.\n\nThe villagers knew tough times lay ahead as they descended the hill, slipping in the mud. For days afterward, when some of them closed their eyes, they could see the lifeless bodies of their neighbors and hear the ring of gunfire.\n\nBut at the pillar, a little cheer went up.\n\n“I was very happy,” Khalida Begum said. “I was crazy, I was excited. I thought: Now we are safe.”\n\nDays later, her eyes filled with tears when she recounted that moment. It was the first time she had allowed herself to believe what the others who helped Rafique out of the village had hoped: that her son would live.\n\nMushfique Wadud contributed to this report.\n\n\n\nMohammed Rafique, center with stick, was wounded during an attack on his village in Burma on Aug. 25.

(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nIn late September 2016, leaders in the House of Representatives met behind closed doors for briefings on a closely held investigation into a group of computer technicians working on Capitol Hill.\n\nInvestigators with the Inspector General’s Office had been quietly tracking the five IT workers’ digital footprints for months. They were alarmed by what they saw. The employees appeared to be accessing congressional servers without authorization, an indication that they “could be reading and/or removing information,” according to documents distributed at the previously unreported private briefings.\n\n\n\nFor some who listened to the findings, the fact that the employees were born in Pakistan set off alarms about national security, according to two participants who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Others thought it more likely that the IT workers, naturalized U.S. citizens, were bending rules on network access to share job duties — violations of House protocol, perhaps, but not espionage.\n\nThe matter was soon referred to the Capitol Police, who have been assisted in their investigation by the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force. In February, the IT workers were barred from accessing the House network, a development that quickly made headlines.\n\nSince then, the story of the House IT workers — brothers Imran Awan, Abid Awan and Jamal Awan, as well as Imran Awan’s wife, Hina Alvi, and friend Rao Abbas — has become a lightning rod charged by the convergence of politics, cybersecurity and fears of foreign intrusion.\n\nIt has attracted unfounded conspiracy theories and intrigue. Far-right news organizations seized on it as a potential coverup of an espionage ring that plundered national secrets and might have been responsible for the campaign hacking of the Democratic National Committee, a breach that intelligence agencies have linked to Russia. President Trump has fanned its embers from his Twitter account, reposting an article that claimed the mainstream media were ignoring a scandal “engulfing” Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat who was slow to fire Imran Awan after news of the investigation broke.\n\nYet, according to a senior congressional official familiar with the probe, criminal investigators have found no evidence that the IT workers had any connection to a foreign government. Investigators looking for clues about espionage instead found that the workers were using one congressional server as if it were their home computer, storing personal information such as children’s homework and family photos, the official said.\n\nEven so, the story — reconstructed here after The Washington Post reviewed confidential documents and interviewed more than a dozen people, including House officials, witnesses and others, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive investigation — highlights urgent and persistent questions about how well Congress safeguards computer equipment and data.\n\nLawyers for some of the IT workers told The Post that their clients had done nothing wrong.\n\nChristopher J. Gowen, one of Imran Awan’s lawyers, called the espionage claims “ludicrous.”\n\n“There’s nothing that Imran did that wasn’t requested by one of his clients on House staff,” he said.\n\nJim Bacon, a lawyer representing Abid Awan, said “a very lax environment” surrounds security protocols in the House. “I can tell you what they were doing was not unusual,” he said.\n\nThe nearly one-year-old investigation has thus far resulted in no charges related to the group’s House IT work. It has burrowed deeply into their personal finances and outside business ventures.\n\nIn July, prosecutors in the U.S. District Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia charged Imran Awan and Alvi with bank fraud, alleging that the couple made misrepresentations on an application for a home-equity loan.\n\n[Congressional IT staffer charged with home equity loan fraud]\n\nImran Awan was arrested at the airport as he was preparing to board a flight to Pakistan, where his wife and three children — ages 4, 7, and 10 — have been since March. He has pleaded not guilty. Alvi is planning to return to the United States in the coming weeks to face bank-fraud charges, according to court records. None of the other IT workers has been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing. Both the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office declined to comment.\n\nChosen in a lottery\n\nImran Awan, now 38, was a 14-year-old living in Pakistan when he filled out an application for a U.S. program that provides limited green cards through a lottery system, his lawyers said. He and his family were chosen. He arrived at 17, got a job working at a fast-food restaurant and went to community college in Northern Virginia. He transferred to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and earned a degree in information technology.\n\n\n\nAwan became a U.S. citizen in 2004, his lawyers said, the same year he was hired for a part-time job as an IT specialist in the office of Rep. Robert Wexler (D-Fla.). Awan had gotten to know some of Wexler’s staffers as an intern for a company that provided services to the office.\n\nAs an IT specialist, Awan set up printers and work email accounts for new employees, and did technical troubleshooting. Charismatic and accommodating, he became a popular choice among House Democrats and soon cobbled together more than a dozen part-time jobs as what is known as a “shared employee” on the Hill, floating between offices on an as-needed basis.\n\nSuch arrangements came under scrutiny in 2008 when House Inspector General James J. Cornell testified that there was “inadequate oversight” over shared employees.\n\n“In most instances, they have all the freedom of a vendor and all the benefits of an employee without the accountability one would expect with an employee,” Cornell told lawmakers. IT specialists, he noted, “present an additional risk in that they often have access to multiple office’s data outside of both the oversight of congressional office staff and the visibility of House security personnel.”\n\nAs demand for Awan’s services grew, he began recommending his family members, who had less formal training. His brother Abid, 33, started working on Capitol Hill in 2005. His wife, 33, joined in 2007. A friend, Rao Abbas, 37, who had most recently worked as a manager at a McDonald’s, was hired in 2012. And Imran’s youngest brother, Jamal, 24, started in 2014. Each held part-time jobs in multiple Democratic congressional offices.\n\n“At the end of the day, whether they had formal training or not, they were trained on the job by Imran,” said one of Imran Awan’s lawyers, Aaron Marr Page.\n\nBy 2016, the five worked for a combined three dozen lawmakers under separate part-time contracts with each office. The Awan family members were each paid between $157,000 and $168,000 that year, making them among the highest-paid staffers on the Hill. The salary cap for a congressional staffer is $174,000.\n\n\n\nUnder House rules, employees in each congressional office are prohibited from sharing their job duties with others who are not directly employed by that office.\n\n\n\n(Source: Guidelines issued by the House Administration Committee)\n\nIn his 2008 testimony, Cornell warned that a “growing number of shared employees are working in illegal teaming arrangements where they pass the work off to other shared employees not on the payroll of the congressional office they are serving.”\n\nGowen, the other attorney representing Imran Awan, acknowledged that the group filled in for each other at times.\n\n\n\n“He’s working with family and friends, so there was some coverage by colleagues,” Gowen said.\n\nOdd invoices\n\nIn March 2016, auditors in the House’s Chief Administrative Office discovered strange invoices for computer equipment — purchases that were broken into multiple payments of less than $500. Any purchases over that amount require equipment to be placed on an inventory that helps to track it.\n\nAfter a referral to the inspector general’s office, investigators found that the IT workers had asked vendors “to split the cost of equipment among multiple items and charged these items as office supplies instead of equipment,” according to the September briefing document.\n\nAs of Sept. 1, 2016, there had been 34 purchases totaling nearly $38,000 “where the costs of the item was manipulated to obtain a purchase price of $499.99,” according to the document. There were $799 iPads and a $640 television on the list, records show.\n\nMost of that equipment was left off the official House inventory, investigators found. And investigators found that some of it had been delivered to the homes of the Awan brothers, according to a person familiar with the investigation.\n\nOne vendor, CDW, received a subpoena from federal prosecutors in December, another person familiar with the procurement part of the probe said. The company said in a statement to The Post that it was cooperating with authorities and that prosecutors had assured the company it was not a target of the investigation.\n\nPage, Imran Awan’s lawyer, said that the home-equipment deliveries were rare and made when his client planned to be away from the Capitol during the delivery. He declined to comment on other aspects of the equipment purchases.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if his client was authorized to split equipment purchases into increments less than $500, Bacon, Abid Awan’s lawyer, said: “In a fluid situation you do what you’re ordered to do.” Any missing equipment, Bacon said, “disappeared after it was brought to the folks who were demanding it. . . . It sounds to me like there’s a lot of scapegoating here.”\n\n\n\nThe House is generally bad at keeping track of the millions of dollars worth of office equipment in its care, according to independent auditors. The past four annual audits have cited “ineffective controls over property and equipment” as a “significant deficiency” in the House, records show. “Inventory processes are not properly designed and are not operating effectively,” an audit found in 2014.\n\n\n\n(Source: House of Representatives Financial Audit Report 2016)\n\nA spokesman for the Chief Administrative Office, which is required to do regular audits of House equipment, declined to comment.\n\nPatrick J. Sowers, a part-time systems administrator for two House Republicans, said that it is common for IT workers to have equipment delivered off campus because deliveries at the Capitol require a time-consuming security screening process that is not necessary if an employee brings the equipment into the building.\n\n“It’s possible that everything was done innocently,” Sowers said. “But when you add it all together, it does give the appearance that something was done inappropriately.”\n\nMapping a trail\n\nBy midsummer, with the approval of the House Administration Committee, the Inspector General’s Office was tracking the five employees’ logins. In October, they found “massive” amounts of data flowing from the networks they were accessing, raising the possibility that an automated program was vacuuming up information, according to a senior House official familiar with the probe.\n\nInitially, investigators could not see precisely what kind of data was moving off the server due to legal protections afforded by the Constitution’s “speech and debate” clause, which shields lawmakers’ deliberations from investigators’ eyes.\n\nInvestigators found that the five IT employees had logged on at one server for the Democratic Caucus more than 5,700 times over a seven-month period, according to documents reviewed by The Post. Alvi, the only one of the five who was authorized to access that server, accounted for fewer than 300 of those logins, documents show.\n\nThe congressional networks they were accessing do not contain any classified information, which is held on separate servers that have rigid protections and very limited access. The House network does contain lawmakers’ email, but a senior House official said IT workers could not access it unless lawmakers provided their passwords.\n\n\n\nThe Inspector General’s Office reported on its findings in a series of briefings in late September and early October in the offices of the House speaker, the Democratic leader, the House Administration Committee, the sergeant at arms and the Capitol Police. The leadership agreed to refer the probe to Capitol Police and the FBI, who had the tools to conduct more thorough background checks and to access their financial records. The criminal investigation began in October.\n\nAt the time, the presidential election was underway, and Hillary Clinton was under FBI investigation to determine whether she had mishandled classified information by using a private email server in the basement of her house while she was secretary of state. About two weeks later, after Trump won the election, House leaders decided to take the highly unusual step of barring the five IT workers from the network.\n\nThe House sergeant at arms convened chiefs of staff in early February and told them that the IT workers were under investigation for suspicion of stealing equipment and potential security violations related to the House network. Most offices fired the IT staffers. But a few Democratic lawmakers defended the Awans, saying that they had not seen definitive evidence that the Awans did anything wrong.\n\n“As of right now, I don’t see a smoking gun,” Rep. Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.) told Politico in March. “I have seen no evidence that they were doing anything that was nefarious.”\n\nWasserman Schultz found a new consulting job for Imran Awan that did not require access to the House network and said publicly that she was concerned that the investigation was driven by ethnic and religious bias. The Awans are Muslims.\n\nHer fierce defense of the Awans at times puzzled even some in her own party. In May, Wasserman Schultz chided the Capitol Police chief during a public hearing after officers confiscated a laptop that had been left in a Capitol Building hallway. It belonged to her office and had been issued to Imran Awan.\n\n“I think you’re violating the rules when you conduct your business that way and should suspect there will be consequences,” Wasserman Schultz told the chief.\n\nShe has also suggested that data moving off her office’s server might have been files the office routinely stored on Dropbox, an Internet-based document-sharing service. House rules prohibit moving data off the main server, but Wasserman Schultz has said in a public hearing that House administrators had not made those rules clear.\n\n“My concern was they were being singled out,” Wasserman Schultz told The Post.\n\n[The story of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and an indicted IT staffer that’s lighting up the right, explained]\n\nWasserman Schultz’s office has said it is cooperating with the investigation. It has hired an outside lawyer, William Pittard, and for a time considered whether to shield any information sought by investigators by asserting “speech and debate” protections.\n\n“Ultimately, the congresswoman chose not to retain a single document on speech or debate or any other grounds in this investigation,” said David Damron, Wasserman Schultz’s communications director. Pittard is being paid by the congresswoman’s campaign for reelection.\n\nSowers, the systems administrator, said that while storing congressional data on Dropbox or other file-sharing services may be convenient, “anyone who is doing it is putting themselves at risk.”\n\n“Hackers are out there constantly,” he said.\n\nPage said he is confident the networking issues that helped kick off the criminal investigation will not result in charges.\n\n“Everything we have heard, once stripped of any conspiratorial overtone, is consistent with how systems were set up and used in member offices,” the lawyer said. “None of this was invented by Imran. We don’t think that any of the systems were in violation of any rules or policies, and certainly Imran didn’t think so at the time.”\n\nHouse staffers, meanwhile, have proposed a series of reforms in response to the controversy. They are under consideration by the House Administration Committee, according to two people with knowledge of the proposal. Those recommendations have not been released publicly, and officials declined to provide them.\n\nThe aftermath\n\nThe disclosure of the investigation led to a torrent of news stories in the conservative press, led by the Daily Caller. The coverage has delved into the Awans’ personal finances, side businesses and family disputes — producing an unflattering portrait.\n\n[Watchdog group asks Congress to investigate Wasserman-Schultz over fired IT aide]\n\nRight-wing conspiracy theorists with large followings on the Internet have spun the revelations into intricate tales, trying to make the case that Imran Awan was the source of leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee that were published by WikiLeaks during last year’s presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia was behind the hacking.\n\nThe unfounded speculation has found its way into coverage by Fox News.\n\n“What if he was the source to WikiLeaks?” Fox News’ Geraldo Rivera said of Imran Awan during a July segment with host Sean Hannity after Awan’s arrest on bank-fraud charges. “He has all the passwords, he has all of the information. This is a huge story.”\n\nAccording to charging documents, Imran Awan and Alvi took out two home-equity loans in December 2016, totaling $283,000, and wired the money to Pakistan on Jan. 18, about a week before they were banned from the House network.\n\nOn bank-loan applications to the Congressional Federal Credit Union, Alvi indicated that the couple lived in the two homes that were offered as collateral — but the homes were actually rental properties, according to the federal indictment. The bank does not offer home-equity loans on rental properties.\n\nImran Awan’s lawyers said Awan and Alvi have repaid the loans by cashing out their retirement funds. Page, Awan’s lawyer, would not address the wire transfers, but said that at the time Awan “was struggling to arrange an elaborate funeral for his father in Pakistan and fighting legal battles over inherited family property there.”\n\n\n\n(Source: Federal indictment)\n\nThey were charged with bank fraud on July 24. Wasserman Schultz fired Imran Awan the same week.\n\nAlvi had already left the United States for Pakistan, in March. Imran Awan’s lawyers said Alvi left to allow the family to rent out their home because they had lost their jobs and “to temporarily escape the media frenzy,” which included “harassment” of her three children at home and at school.\n\nFederal agents and Capitol Police tried to question her at Dulles International Airport, but ultimately let her and her children board the plane. An FBI agent wrote in a court document that he did not believe she intended to come back. Alvi has agreed to return to the United States in late September, according to court documents.\n\nImran Awan is living with a relative in Virginia and wearing a GPS tracking device. He has given up his passport and is restricted from traveling farther than 50 miles from the home where he is staying.\n\nAppearing at Imran Awan’s first court appearance on Sept. 1 was George Webb, a self-described citizen journalist from Fort Wayne, Ind., who has cultivated 40,000 followers by posting hundreds of conspiratorial videos on YouTube.\n\nHe filed papers asking the judge if he could present evidence in the bank-fraud case that would reveal a host of other crimes, including money laundering to terrorist organizations. The judge denied the unusual request. Outside the courthouse, Webb said that he believed prosecutors were conspiring with Awan’s lawyers to minimize the case.\n\n“They’re orchestrating this thing, making it look like there’s a trial here,” Webb said. “There’s no trial here. They are trying to make this look like a small, simple bank fraud case. It’s not. It’s a spy ring in Congress.”","author":"Shawn Boburg, Shawn Boburg","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T12:13:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/09/16/Others/Images/2017-09-13/IMRAN-AWAN2881_copy.JPG?t=20170517","digest":"Noy8mCS9v2qD8CZPPylCRw==\n"}

(John Locher/AP)\n\nThe fight was all but certain to be action-packed. And on that score, it did not disappoint. But it was also supposed to determine the best middleweight boxer in the world. And in that, it fell short.\n\nGennady Golovkin retained his World Boxing Association, World Boxing Council, and International Boxing Federation title belts by way of a split decision draw with Canelo Alvarez on Saturday night in Las Vegas — a decision which was met with audible groans from what had been a raucous crowd of 22,358 at T-Mobile Arena.\n\nThe bout had a tactical beginning, but it wasn’t long before the two began to exchange. What little boxing was done in the latter half of the bout was done by Alvarez — who manage to fend off Golvkin’s intense pressure with occasional, well-timed counter shots.\n\nThe defensive maneuvers bothered Golovkin, who preferred to trade all night.\n\n“It’s not my fault,” Golovkin said of the rare moments of inactivity in the bout. “I put pressure on every round.”\n\nAlvarez, meanwhile, took a jab at Golovkin’s vaunted power — calling it a bit overrated.\n\nDespite the criticism they offered of the other, Golovkin and Alvarez were in full agreement on one point.\n\n“Of course I want the rematch,” Golovkin said.\n\n“Yes, of course,” Alvarez added.\n\nThey are not alone.\n\nSo….\n\nWho's up for a rematch? #GGG #Canelo pic.twitter.com/YByFLH0d0c — theScore (@theScore) September 17, 2017\n\nOne of the best fights I've seen in years!! #caneloGGG Bring on the rematch!!! pic.twitter.com/5dAlIEE0qH — Matt Goss (@mattgoss) September 17, 2017\n\nJust fine with a rematch. But 118-110 Canelo? Judge probably thought Tommy Hearns landed a lucky punch on my guy Martin \"Raw Dog\" Payne. — Justin Tinsley (@JustinTinsley) September 17, 2017\n\nThe scores broke down like this: Judge Dave Moretti had it 115-113 for Golovkin, Judge Don Trella scored it 114-114. And Judge Adalaide Byrd scored the fight 118-110 for Alvarez.\n\nThat latter uneven score dominated much of the postfight discussion. Alvarez undoubtedly had his moments — particularly in the early stages. And one could even justifiably give him the nod. But many ringside found Byrd’s 118-110 card — one in which she awarded only the fourth and seventh to Golovkin — to be outrageous.\n\nHere’s how the fight shook out, round-by-round.\n\nRound 1: Very little action in the first 90 seconds, but Alvarez lands the first meaningful blow with a counter to the body. Golovkin lands a few jabs, but Alvarez is able to take advantage of some Golvokin misses by landing several decent shots. More than enough to carry a slow opening round.\n\nThese two already dead even when it comes to walkout attire.

Golovkin looks more comfortable in this round, but it hasn’t translated to his trademark furious offensive attack. Alvarez, with his back to the ropes, lands a strong body shot to punctuate the frame, likely the second that he’s banked.\n\n.@Canelo's corner after Rd 2: \"@GGGBoxing is very slow. He's strong but slow. The middle of the ring is where you dominate him.\" #CaneloGGG pic.twitter.com/LboFI3PWgM — HBOboxing (@HBOboxing) September 17, 2017\n\nRound 3: Golvokin has picked up the tempo in this round, and is launching a sustained attack. He’s managed to close the distance a bit, as Alvarez’s counters have not been quite as effective in the third. Golovkin most likely gets on the board.\n\nAfter 3 Rounds of #CaneloGGG, @shotfighter26 scores it 2-1 @Canelo. pic.twitter.com/KHQra1nqbo — HBOboxing (@HBOboxing) September 17, 2017\n\nRound 4: Alvarez is making it a point to go to the body — a strategic gamble he’s hoping will pay off in the later rounds. But for now, Golovkin has plenty of energy, and plenty of starch on his punches. A superb combination midway through the round scores for Golovkin, and he has taken control in this round. Golovkin lands a perfect right cross, then several more shots to close out an excellent fourth.\n\nRound 5: Alvarez, sensing the momentum shift, comes out aggressively to open the fifth. But Golovkin promptly reasserts control with an effective combination against the ropes. Golovkin lands a perfect right hook on Alvarez which brought the crowd to life. Alvarez withstood a furious rally, though, and managed to fight his way off the ropes. This has been a more tactical bout than expected to this point. But the fireworks might be about to begin.\n\nRound 6: Two vicious right hand shots for Golovkin, who picks up right where he left off to open the sixth. Alvarez has shown a tremendous chin, and he fights his way back into the frame. But the Golovkin work rate is carrying the day. Alvarez appears to have lost just a bit of zip on his punches. Golovkin is just cutting off the ring beautifully, giving Alvarez no place to run. Another Golovkin round.\n\nAfter 6 rounds of #CaneloGGG, @shotfighter26 scores it 4-2 @GGGBoxing. pic.twitter.com/uOrHlyGonF — HBOboxing (@HBOboxing) September 17, 2017\n\nRound 7: The tempo slows a bit, to Alvarez’s advantage. This bout belongs to Alvarez in the center of the rings, and it belongs to Golovkin when Alvarez is on the ropes. The first two minutes of the round were strong for Alvarez. The last belonged to Golovkin. Very tough round to score. Alvarez might get the jump ball here.\n\nWho do you have winning through 7 rounds? #CaneloGGG — Manny Pacquiao (@mannypacquiao) September 17, 2017\n\nRound 8: Golovkin wastes no time, and lands a killer combination to open the round. He’s just getting off quicker now. Alvarez may be starting to fatigue, but he lands an outstanding right uppercut with his back to the ropes to momentarily ward off the sustained Golovkin pressure. That shot, alone, though, was nowhere near good enough to win him the round.\n\nLampley on @Canelo in Rd 8: \"We's walking way. He's making @GGGBoxing look like a freight train.\" #CaneloGGG pic.twitter.com/XPwQZTZ6Dy — HBOboxing (@HBOboxing) September 17, 2017\n\nRound 9: Alvarez has abandoned the pretense of boxing. And here we go. This is the fight the experts predicted. They’re in a phone booth now. Alvarez lands a monster right hook about midway through the frame. And Golovkin hardly flinches. The Golovkin pressure is simply relentless. Alvarez badly wants a breather, and Golovkin just won’t let him have one. This is another close round. Golovkin may have taken it based on effective aggressiveness.\n\nRound 10: Alvarez is letting his hands go now, perhaps sensing the fight slip away. And he wobbles Golovkin with furious barrage in the center of the ring. But Golovkin manages to get his sea legs back, and it’s not long before he’s once again applying the pressure. Vicious exchange to close out the round — to the roar of the capacity crowd of 22,358.\n\n\"It's rock-em, sock-em robots right now.\" — @MaxKellerman on #CaneloGGG pic.twitter.com/E7lavPdabX — HBOboxing (@HBOboxing) September 17, 2017\n\nRound 11: Alvarez has shown a tremendous heart and chin, and he takes control of a comparatively slow round at about the halfway point. Golovkin, who knocked out 23 straight opponents prior to his last fight, just has not been able to connect on the home run swing — and he’s tried several. Alvarez seemed to feed off the emotion of the crowd, and probably did enough to take the penultimate round.\n\nRound 12: They both want it bad, and they both know it’s close. Alvarez, who began to turn the tide in the 11th, dominates the first minute of the closing round. But Golovkin jabs his way back in, and lands on a tiring Alvarez. The tanks are empty here — particularly Alvarez’s. But these two are giving everything they’ve got with the fight on the table. The closing bell sounds. It was as superb as expected. Before the decision is even announced, one word can already be heard en masse on press row: Rematch.\n\nOn the pop culture front, check out some of the A-listers in the audience.\n\nThe stars are out for #CaneloGGG! pic.twitter.com/5FkjpfpGbR — Def Pen Sports (@DefPenSports) September 17, 2017\n\nThe stars are out for #CaneloGGG. @chrisbrown @RealMiguelCotto pic.twitter.com/gq1obcNFsb — HBOboxing (@HBOboxing) September 17, 2017\n\nMore stars enjoying #CaneloGGG. pic.twitter.com/nEyyP0ZPAe — HBOboxing (@HBOboxing) September 17, 2017\n\nAlong with Charles Barkley, Michael J.

Hundreds of soldiers have been deployed across strategic sites, the Metropolitan Police said.\n\nVideo\n\nDover, about 75 miles from London, is one of the main ports on the English Channel for ferry services linking Britain with mainland Europe.\n\nAs part of the bombing investigation, armed officers on Saturday were searching at least one house in Sunbury-on-Thames, on the outskirts of the capital and about three miles from Heathrow Airport in London, according to The Associated Press, the BBC and other local news outlets.\n\nThe police confirmed that a residential address in the area had been evacuated and was being searched, but declined to say if the operation was linked to the suspect arrested.\n\nSunbury is 10 miles west of Parsons Green, where the explosion occurred.

No one was killed in the attack, but several people were hospitalized for injuries including burns and fractures.\n\nThe terrorist attack was the fifth major assault in Britain in less than six months, and the first to hit mass transit since the deadly bombings of 2005 that killed 52 people.

But how she got off, was rescued a second time and then ended up in the morgue is one of Hurricane Harvey’s mysteries.","title":"Twice Saved From Houston Floods but Still, Mysteriously, a Victim","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/16/us/hurricane-harvey-houston-wilma-ellis.html","text":"At the time her son believed she was being ferried to higher ground, she was found floating face down in the floodwater. In what became one of the day’s elegiac moments, Ms. Ellis was resuscitated by a group of civilian boaters from Louisiana, part of an informal organization known as the Cajun Navy. That moment was hailed on national television and social media as an example of heroism and the bond between two hurricane-pummeled Gulf Coast states.\n\nBut with a huge, chaotic rescue effort underway, much of it handled by private citizens who took matters into their own hands, few people paid attention to Ms. Ellis’s next 10 hours.\n\nOne Woman, Twice Saved\n\nThe peak of desperation for northeast Houston residents inundated by Hurricane Harvey came on Monday, Aug. 28. Greens Bayou had swelled to a record 43.4 feet where it crossed Tidwell Road, dislodging cars and ripping apartment walls down to their studs.\n\nIn the middle-class, predominantly black neighborhood where Ms. Ellis lived in a one-story brick house, people woke in the wee hours to find the water seeping in. Hundreds — if not thousands — of people escaped in watercraft of every description. The water turned thick and oily, boiling with angry clusters of fire ants.\n\nSometime around 7 a.m., three men in a boat motored up the driveway of Ms. Ellis’s house on Drifting Winds Drive.\n\nMs. Ellis was an energetic woman — a committed Jehovah’s Witness who made boudin sausage from scratch, played video games on a Sega Genesis, drove a gargantuan pickup truck with a grille the size of a portcullis and enjoyed the occasional nip of Windsor Canadian.\n\nBut she had recently had surgery, followed by a stroke, family members said.\n\nSo Mr. Ellis didn’t stop to ask exactly who the men in the boat were — he just helped his mother aboard. She still wore the hospital bracelet from her recent treatment. Unbeknown to him, the boat had barely reached the corner stop sign when his mother somehow fell into the floodwater.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“They were trying to make a right, but the boat tipped over,” said a neighbor, Desmond Clark, who was peering through the rain from his window on Parkway Forest Drive. He added, “I didn’t see nobody go get her.”\n\nMr. Clark said the person in the water floated one direction, accompanied by the garbage bags, while the others propped the boat against a truck to drain it, then climbed back in and headed the opposite way.\n\n“I’m not thinking to myself, ‘Oh, she’s drowning,’ because she didn’t look like she was drowning,” Mr. Clark said. “She looked like she was swimming.”\n\nSoon three boaters from St. Tammany Parish, La., members of the Cajun Navy, saw something floating in the water. At first, they thought it was a trash bag. Then they realized it was a body.\n\nTwo of them, identified in news reports as Ricky Berrigan and Donnie Davenport, jumped out while a third, Joshua Lincoln, stayed with the boat, Mr. Lincoln said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe woman had lost one of her dentures, and the other was blocking her airway, according to Mr. Lincoln. She appeared to be dead.\n\n“I don’t know what made them do it,” he said, but they started performing chest compressions. “After that she started breathing slowly.”\n\nUnable to lift her into the boat, the men recruited two neighbors to help. “She was alive,” said one, Brando Flanagan. “She was nodding. I just told her, ‘You’re going to be all right, mami. You’re going to be all right.’” He cringed, remembering. “I looked in her eye. I told her she was going to be O.K.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the time, hospitals were virtually impossible to reach. The boaters took Ms. Ellis to the nearest dry corner, where people were sheltering at a day care center and a gas station. “I was concerned that she wouldn’t set up in a chair too well,” Mr. Lincoln said, “so we got them to say they would be extra watchful of her.”\n\nHe snapped a photo of her, still wearing the black turban-style head covering she had left home in, with a cozy brown blanket draped over her. He took a close-up of the hospital bracelet bearing her name and date of birth.\n\nJust after 8 a.m., another evacuee posted on Facebook that a Wilma Ellis had been rescued and needed help.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She was brought in, the records said, by the Coast Guard — or maybe, a hospital spokesman said later, the Fire Department. The hospital bracelet was missing. Wilma Ellis was a Jane Doe.\n\nHailed as a Hero\n\nThat night, China Davis was at the hospital where she worked when the phone rang. “Somebody called me and told me that my sister was floating in the water,” she said. “‘China, your sister is on CNN.’”\n\nMs. Davis was confused — her nephew, Carl, had told her that Ms. Ellis had been taken to a nearby school. He was still waiting to be rescued himself.\n\nBut there was the voice of Mr. Lincoln on television, describing how he had found Ms. Ellis in an “extremely heavy current.”\n\nWilma Ellis I love you always, so grateful to Jehovah that you are here with us. Posted by China Davis on Tuesday, August 29, 2017\n\nThe newscasters hung on Mr. Lincoln’s words. “You were just moved to act?” they asked. “How is she doing now?”\n\nAs is common in natural disasters, accurate information was scarce. On Tuesday, Mr. Lincoln told MSNBC, “She is now with her family, they say, and doing just fine.” He had gotten an address, he said, so he could return her dentures.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Ms. Ellis’s family did not know where she was.\n\nThey called hospitals and shelters. They got in touch with Mr. Lincoln, who joined the search by posting on social media and doing follow-up interviews. One man said he had seen her at a shelter. But still, no one could find her.\n\nIt was not until Thursday that Ms. Davis received a call from the morgue.\n\nCombing Through Clues\n\nMs. Ellis, who spent her childhood picking cotton in rural north Louisiana and later worked at a hospital in Houston, was a matriarchal figure in an extended clan — she had seven siblings, six children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. They called her Mama, or Jean.\n\nTo find her, they had been sifting anxiously through the meager clues, left like shreds of storm debris snagged on a chain-link fence. But now that they knew she was dead, those clues refused to add up. How, if she had nearly drowned, had the turban remained on her head? In the photograph taken by Mr. Lincoln, didn’t she look dry?\n\nMore important, where had she been left, and with whom? Had there been foul play? Or had someone, some of them wondered, simply failed to care enough about a lone, old black woman?\n\nThe red tape did not help. Her son, Carl Ellis, went to get her medical records, but came away empty-handed because he had no death certificate. The autopsy report would not be available for weeks. Ms. Ellis had been identified using fingerprints, the medical examiner’s office said.\n\nBut there was an official cause of death: drowning. That raised more questions — if she had been revived, how had she drowned? Had she been fished from the water only to be swallowed up again? Could she have gone through something destructive enough to wrest the hospital bracelet from her wrist?\n\n“My mom wouldn’t have wandered off,” Mr. Ellis said. He wondered if she had been left to fend for herself. “If I saw an elderly man or an elderly woman, I wouldn’t do that. I would stay with them, make sure they’re all right.”\n\nBut medical experts said drowning could be listed as the cause of death even if Ms. Ellis initially survived. The autopsy could have found fluid lurking in her lungs, or the near drowning could have led to fatal complications because of weakened organs, unbalanced blood chemistry or a swollen airway. With immediate medical attention, she might have survived. If emergency medical workers had tried to treat her at any point, they may well have cut off the hospital bracelet to get it out of the way.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Ellis may have been watched over, but nobody seems to remember. A man who worked at the gas station where Ms. Ellis was first dropped off said he could not recall seeing her during the storm. Less than two miles away, close to an emergency staging ground, was another gas station, where hundreds of evacuees were taken.\n\nPhoto\n\nEmployees there did not remember Ms. Ellis, either. But one, Karim Musani, took a second look at the photo Mr. Lincoln had taken. “I can remember this brown thing,” he said, indicating the plush blanket. “I picked it up. When I picked it up, it was so heavy.”\n\nPicking Up the Pieces\n\nMore than a week after his mother’s death, Mr. Ellis pulled his mother’s truck into the driveway of her ruined home; his own car had flooded. Wearing a pair of denim overalls, he prepared for the job of mucking out and sorting through.\n\nThe day before, he had avoided a gathering of 13 family members on the driveway, and still seemed lost in self-reproach over what had happened. Asked what he had thought when he had heard of his mother’s rescue on the news, he demurred. “When my mom left here,” he said, “I thought that was her rescue.”\n\nA few days later, Mr. Lincoln drove back to Houston for Ms. Ellis’s funeral. Emotionally overwhelmed, he said, he got lost on the way. Mr. Lincoln said he had been “drastically” affected by finding, then losing, Ms. Ellis. “The whole thing just sounds spiritual in that I was reborn, or born again, when I found her,” he said. “It’s like I can’t tell a lie anymore.”\n\nBut at the memorial service, he encountered a family still under strain from the unanswered — perhaps never to be answered — questions about Ms. Ellis’s final hours.\n\nMs. Campbell, Ms. Ellis’s sister, said she had tried to help. “I tried to get them one by one and sit down and explain something to them: time and unforeseen occurrences befalls us all,” she said, paraphrasing Scripture. “There’s only two people who know what really happened — Jean, and Jehovah.”","author":"Shaila Dewan","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T01:21:24.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/17/us/17rescue-02-SUB/17rescue-02-SUB-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg","digest":"F3atd/jtC2TI8TvtZfVU6Q==\n"}

The Obama administration had faced a similar lawsuit before it decided in late 2009 to start to make visitor logs public, a practice that stopped with Mr. Trump’s arrival.\n\n“After waiting months for a response to our request for comprehensive visitor logs from the president’s multiple visits to Mar-a-Lago and having the government ask for a last minute extension, today we received 22 names from the Japanese prime minister’s visit to Mar-a-Lago and nothing else,” Mr. Bookbinder said in a statement. “The government does not believe that they need to release any further Mar-a-Lago visitor records. We vehemently disagree. The government seriously misrepresented their intentions to both us and the court. This was spitting in the eye of transparency. We will be fighting this in court.”\n\nTom Blanton, director of the nonprofit National Security Archive, said his group was told by a Justice Department lawyer that the Secret Service did not keep a formal log of visitors to Mar-a-Lago similar to what is maintained for the White House. Instead, Mr. Blanton said he expected on Friday to get copies of hundreds of Secret Service emails that listed the names of presidential visitors to Mar-a-Lago, which, once assembled, would represent as comprehensive a list as possible.\n\nMr. Trump visited Mar-a-Lago for 25 days between his inauguration and the middle of May, when the club closes for the summer.

(2:27)\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- It’s no longer about Kelly Bryant filling the shoes of the departed Deshaun Watson. Indeed, Watson has already set the bar higher.\n\n“He’s going to be better than me,” the former Clemson quarterback tweeted after Bryant led the Tigers to a touchdown in the first half of their dominant 47-21 victory over Louisville on Saturday night.\n\nIt’s an absurd premise, or at least it should be. Watson is a legend, the best player to don a Clemson jersey. He was a Heisman Trophy finalist each of the past two seasons, finishing third in 2015 and runner-up in 2016. He led the Tigers to consecutive national title games, winning last season's championship with an epic final drive. No one fills those shoes.\n\nExcept, through three games, Bryant has.\n\nHe wasn’t supposed to win the starting job with more highly recruited talent on the roster, but he led the QB battle wire to wire, and it wasn’t really all that close.\n\nHe took his first snap as a starter in Week 1, and six plays into that career he’d dished out a 61-yard touchdown pass.\n\nIn his first road start, quarterback Kelly Bryant directed a Clemson whipping of Louisville and defending Heisman Trophy winner Lamar Jackson. Joe Robbins/Getty Images\n\nHe toppled his first top-25 opponent a week later, getting leveled on a tackle by Auburn’s ferocious defense that sent him to the sideline for a series. When he re-entered the game, he was a new man, a force to be reckoned with.\n\nAnd then Saturday, Bryant went toe-to-toe with the reigning Heisman winner, and he outplayed Lamar Jackson by leaps and bounds.\n\n“I just did my job, everything the coaches asked of me,” Bryant said after the game, wearing a sharp blue suit and a confident smile and offering little to suggest any of this has come as a surprise to him.\n\nTigers coach Dabo Swinney was a bit more open to the idea that his junior quarterback wasn’t quite such a sure thing a month ago, but the performance thus far has been every bit ... well, Watson-like.\n\n“I didn’t know,” Swinney said. “I was hoping he’d take what we’d seen in practice to the opening game, and he did. I was hoping he’d respond to adversity against Auburn, and he did. I was hoping he’d man up on the road and beat these guys like a dang competitor and a confident dude, and he did.”\n\nTo be sure, so much of that poise and confidence and command of the offense is Bryant’s natural state. But a portion, too, comes from Watson. It’s the peripheral benefit of sharing a sideline with the best there ever was at Clemson, and the lessons Watson taught over the past couple years are being deployed to perfection now.\n\n“He’s a proud father,” Swinney said. “He mentored [Bryant] for two years. Don’t discount how big that is for Kelly.”\n\nFor so much of the offseason, the chatter surrounding Bryant was some version of “be your own man.” Shaking the shadow of Watson was perhaps his biggest obstacle.\n\nAnd yet, here he is, three games into his career as a starter, and the comparisons seem less a burden than a badge of honor. Bryant isn’t shaken by the past. He’s building on it.\n\n“He was awesome, man,” receiver Ray-Ray McCloud said after Saturday’s game. “He was the best quarterback on the field. He’s just built different, the way he carries himself, his character.”\n\nBryant's final numbers Saturday -- 316 yards passing, 61 on the ground (not counting sacks) and 3 total touchdowns -- underscored McCloud’s assertion that Bryant had clearly outdueled Jackson. But a year ago, when Louisville nearly felled Clemson at home, Watson turned the ball over four times. Bryant had no such setbacks, looking poised throughout, mixing big plays with short runs and, as Swinney noted, converting again and again on third down to keep the ball out of Jackson’s hands.\n\nIt’s still the longest of long shots that Bryant will someday eclipse Watson’s reputation at Clemson, but the idea that there will be a smooth transition from a legend to the little-known understudy is no longer a pipe dream. It’s reality, and this is Kelly Bryant's team, a team with a real chance to win another national championship.\n\n“Let them sleep on me,” Bryant said. “I’ve been doubted my whole career. Keep doubting.”","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T05:58:25.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0916%2Fr259632_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"4kXSTIICUNUvG69cVACtSQ==\n"}

The ambulance then took away the slightly injured government worker without attending to the severely wounded man lying on the ground.\n\nDespite his injuries, the casualty was handcuffed. A second ambulance later arrived but Nguyen was pronounced dead when he arrived at hospital.\n\n'Excessive use of force'\n\nTaiwan's government watchdog Control Yuan has launched an investigation into what happened amid protests by rights groups. Prosecutors have also begun an inquiry.\n\nThe dead man's father, Nguyen Quoc Dong, said: \"I only have one demand: Taiwan's government should say clearly what happened and why.\"\n\nTaiwan's 'slave fishermen'\n\nAfter British man abused, Taiwan debates its hidden racism\n\nThe case has sparked debate about the treatment of migrant workers in the country.\n\nAsked why emergency crews did not help Nguyen immediately, a paramedic from the Hsinchu County Fire Bureau's San Chi substation told the BBC: \"The police officer told us not to get close.\n\n\"What if [the migrant] suddenly became crazy and did something? And he hadn't been handcuffed, so we couldn't do anything.\"\n\nThe National Police Agency had said Nguyen had attacked the officer and the government worker when they tried to stop him from vandalising and stealing a car.\n\nImage caption Dashcam footage from the ambulance shows a government worker being driven away while the dying man (top) lies in a pool of blood next to a police car\n\nBut his father questioned the police's version of events.\n\n\"I don't believe what the police said that my son tried to steal a car. He can't even drive,\" he said.\n\n\"I think there was excessive use of force.\"\n\nThe Taiwan International Workers Association (TIWA), which organised a protest on Friday, urged the authorities to release any footage related to the case. Ambulance dash cam footage was later obtained by the BBC but was not broadcast due to its distressing nature.\n\nIt is not clear whether the police officer or his car were equipped with a camera.\n\nTrapped\n\nTaiwan is a major destination for migrant workers, employing more than 600,000 in factories, homes and in other manual labour.\n\nActivists say they are often trapped into paying off huge debt to employment brokers, so many run away from their jobs to avoid having big chunks deducted from their salary. They instead work in the black market illegally but they risk getting arrested.\n\nNguyen had run away from his job three years ago.\n\nSpeakers at the protest on Friday criticised the government and law enforcement authorities' practice of treating runaway migrants like criminals.\n\n\"I ask Taiwanese people, how come some people can change employers and some can't? And those who run away from their jobs are arrested and even shot by police. These incidents are happening in so called democratic Taiwan,\" said the TIWA's researcher Hsu Wei-dung.\n\n\"Only when the whole Taiwanese society and government really face up to this problem can we really change this,\" he said.","author":"BBC News","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T13:07:13.000Z"},"source":"bbc-news","urlToImage":"https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/F58F/production/_97836826_migrantworkerdeathdemo.jpg","digest":"DPsm6JuVeztK3xUlvaVLkg==\n"}

If the two teams had identical records at the end of the season, there would be a play-off.\n\nLukaku adds late sheen\n\nLukaku, who left Everton to join United for £75m in July, was kept quiet for most of the game but set up Mkhitaryan with a smart pass to punish a costly Ashley Williams mistake, and then celebrated in front of the away fans when he scored the third a minute from time.\n\nThe Belgium international has scored five goals in his five league appearances for his new club but did miss a great chance in the first half.\n\nClean through on goal after another defensive error, he fired wastefully wide in front of the Stretford End.\n\nBut he took his chance clinically in the last minute. His initial free-kick hit the wall, but when the ball was played back in, he latched on to Jesse Lingard's flick to fire in, before cupping his ears to the Everton fans.\n\nLonely return for Rooney\n\nOnly two Everton players had more touches than Wayne Rooney (73)\n\nRooney scored 253 goals for United in his 13 years at the club, but after an expected and justified warm welcome on his return, he cut a frustrated and lonely figure at times.\n\nHis move back to boyhood club Everton in July was widely heralded, and his two goals this season remain the club's only strikes in the Premier League.\n\nEngland and Manchester United may have decided in recent years that his best position is not up front but he started there and was isolated for long periods before moving deeper in the second half.\n\nHe had Everton's two best chances, steering a shot wide in the first half and then shooting straight at David de Gea seconds after the interval.\n\nRooney was given a standing ovation and handshake from Mourinho when replaced inside the last 10 minutes - after which Everton collapsed. It is now 325 minutes since they scored in the league.\n\nEverton in trouble?\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Result difficult to understand - Koeman\n\nKoeman spent lavishly this summer on Rooney, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Michael Keane, Jordan Pickford and Davy Klaassen to build - on paper at least - a strong Premier League squad.\n\nBut in failing to replace Lukaku, he left the side short of pace and mobility up front - as well as goals.\n\nThe Toffees turned in a dismal performance against Tottenham last weekend and were even worse against Atalanta in their Europa League opener on Thursday night.\n\nSunday's trip to Old Trafford always looked an ominous way to end a tough week and from the moment Valencia cracked in his sensational opener, the writing was on the wall for a manager who had admitted before the match that he was \"worried\".\n\nAfter the game, he admitted that his side looked \"afraid\" and lacked confidence.\n\nIn the opening 10 minutes, Manchester United (left, attacking from bottom to top) had plenty of touches in Everton's half - while the visitors (right) had none in the home side's half\n\nThe men in blue were perhaps blameless for Valencia's superb strike but they were so deep in the opening exchanges that Sigurdsson was practically playing at left-back.\n\nEverton have faced four of last season's top six in their opening five games, but have only mustered 10 shots on target all season.\n\nThey improved markedly in the second half - before United's late flurry of goals - but are yet to get the best out of their new signings. and find themselves in the relegation zone for the first time since the opening day of the 2011-12 season.\n\nKoeman now has four games in a row at home. He needs wins.\n\n'We deserved more'\n\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman: \"We deserved more than we got. We made a big mistake by Ashley Williams at 1-0 and after that it was over.\n\n\"What I saw from the team made me happy. More happy than Thursday at Atalanta.\n\n\"It's really difficult, as a manager you try to help and support them - but when the whistle starts it's all about them. We started too afraid.\n\n\"We have four home games in different competitions and we need to win, otherwise we'll have problems.\"\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Scoreline flattered Man Utd - Mourinho\n\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho: \"The first 30-35 minutes was probably our best performance of the season.\n\n\"Everton are going to be fine but they are living a difficult moment.\n\n\"The fixtures they got, I wouldn't like these fixtures for me all together at the same time. I would like to play against one of the top five - but all of them, that is not fair for them.\"\n\nMan of the match - Nemanja Matic (Manchester United)\n\nManchester United were without the injured Paul Pogba but Matic controlled the game after making Valencia's early goal\n\nCan we play you every week?\n\nManchester United have now beaten Everton 34 times in the Premier League, a joint record in the competition (also held by United, who have beaten Aston Villa 34 times).\n\nAt his sixth attempt in the Premier League, Jose Mourinho finally defeated Ronald Koeman, ending a run of five matches without a win against the Dutchman (D4 L1).\n\nEverton have scored four goals in their last 10 Premier League games - they had scored 26 goals in the 10 prior to this run.\n\nThe Toffees are winless in their last 11 away Premier League games (D5 L6), their worst run since May 2004 (also 11 without a win).\n\nRomelu Lukaku has scored five goals in his first five Premier League appearances for Manchester United, a record matched only by Louis Saha and Robin van Persie.\n\nEverton have failed to score in four consecutive matches in all competitions for the first time since April 2006.\n\nWhat next?\n\nManchester United face Burton Albion in the EFL Cup on Wednesday before a rare Saturday 15:00 BST engagement at Southampton.

Vettel was expected to re-take the lead at a track on which Ferrari had an advantage over Mercedes. Instead, Hamilton heads into the final six races of the season with a 28-point advantage.\n\nHamilton did so after one of his most impressive drives. Mercedes went into the race thinking about damage limitation, with team boss Toto Wolff talking about the best possible result being to limit the loss of points to Vettel.\n\nIt was the first time Ferrari have retired both cars on the first lap, ever\n\nBut the Briton managed to avoid the chaos on the run to the first corner and slotted into the lead ahead of Daniel Ricciardo.\n\nThe Australian would have been expected to challenge Hamilton, Red Bull having had a clear pace advantage over Mercedes all weekend.\n\nBut Hamilton began reeling off fastest laps, and he remained serene through a madcap race that started wet, was dry for almost half its distance, featured three safety cars as a result of a series of incidents and ran to only 58 of its scheduled 61 laps because of the two-hour time limit.\n\nA crucial misjudgement?\n\nThe first safety car came almost immediately. Despite heavy rain falling and a wet track, the race started competitively rather than behind a safety car.\n\nVerstappen, starting second, made a better start than Vettel did from pole, but both were out-done by Raikkonen, who moved to the inside and was soon edging ahead of the Red Bull.\n\nNot knowing his team-mate was there, Vettel veered aggressively across the track to defend from Verstappen, leaving the Dutchman nowhere to go.\n\nVerstappen tried to edge left to avoid Vettel, but he and Raikkonen touched, the Finn spun and collected his team-mate.\n\nFernando Alonso goes flying - an innocent victim in the first-corner madness\n\nRaikkonen slid sideways down the track and hit Verstappen broadside at the first corner, the two careering into Fernando Alonso's McLaren, which was briefly up to third place behind Vettel and Hamilton and ahead of Ricciardo as he took his usual outside line at the first corner.\n\nAlonso's car was launched, and spun in mid-air, damaging his floor and side-pod and leading to his retirement after a few slow laps.\n\nVettel, who was in scintillating form in taking pole on Saturday, tried to continue, but his car was badly damaged, its front wing missing and fluid leaking from the rear.\n\nThis caught him out as he accelerated out of Turn Three, and he spun into the wall after losing grip on his car's own fluids at Turn Four. He was told to retire before getting halfway around the first lap.\n\nReaction to the incident\n\nAll three men were called to the stewards to explain the incident but officials decided that \"no driver was wholly or predominantly to blame\" and decided to take no further action.\n\nVettel said: \"I didn't see that much. I saw Max and then the next thing I see is Max and Kimi hitting me somewhere. It doesn't change much. Obviously we are not in the race and can't show the pace we have.\"\n\nVerstappen said: \"I think mainly Sebastian started squeezing me. Maybe he did not see Kimi on the left but that is not an excuse. He shouldn't take those risks.\n\n\"Lewis is leading the race and the three of us are out. I don't think it was a racing incident. Three cars were taken out and I was in the middle not doing anything wrong. We will see what happens.\"\n\nRaikkonen said: \"I don't know, there are always different views and I could not do anything to avoid it.\"\n\nThe race takes place at night under floodlights...\n\nFloodlights which need to be extremely bright\n\nA let down for Red Bull\n\nThe result will be a disappointment for Red Bull, with Ricciardo having said before the race that he was confident of winning.\n\nInstead, handicapped within a few laps by a gearbox problem, he found that whatever he threw at Hamilton, the Mercedes driver was more than able to answer and he had to settle for second.\n\nMercedes benefited doubly from the chaos at the start - Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas, who struggled for pace all weekend, finished third, strengthening the team's hold on the constructors' championship.\n\nThere was some succour for Red Bull, as their junior driver Carlos Sainz drove an excellent race to take fourth for Toro Rosso after being ninth on the first lap, moving ahead of Force India's Sergio Perez, Renault's Jolyon Palmer, McLaren's Stoffel Vandoorne and Force India's Esteban Ocon, who were all ahead of him on the first lap.\n\nSingapore slick: that's 60 career wins for Hamilton now\n\nSainz did benefit, however, from the retirement of Renault's Nico Hulkenberg, who was running fourth when he had to stop because of an engine oil leak on lap 38.\n\nSainz's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was the cause of the second safety car when he crashed on lap 11 at Turn Seven, Sauber's Marcus Ericsson triggering the third when he spun out of Turn 12 and ended up facing the wrong way on the narrow Anderson Bridge.\n\nPerez took fifth, Palmer enjoyed the best result of his F1 career in sixth and Vandoorne was seventh.\n\nDriver of the day\n\nThere's only one winner. The reasons for Mercedes' turnaround from Saturday to Sunday remain unclear, even to the team, but Lewis Hamilton was at his magnificent best, totally in control of a race in which he was expected to struggle. It was one of his greatest wins. An honourable mention, too, for Carlos Sainz, who was superb in taking fourth for Toro Rosso.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThere's a two-week break before another brutally hot race in Malaysia, on a very different circuit. On paper, Sepang looks like a Mercedes track and Hamilton will go into the weekend as favourite and looking for a fourth win in a row. Weather is often a factor there, too.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device How does Jack Nicholls prepare for the Singapore GP?\n\nWhat they said\n\nRace-winner Hamilton: \"I want to congratulate my team, they did a fantastic job. We struggled yesterday and we had no idea what would happen today. We were fortunate with what happened with the Ferraris at the beginning but I could not be happier.\n\n\"I capitalised on the incident. Who would know what would happen? Daniel put up a really good fight today. I hoped I would get to race Sebastian at the beginning. Of course it is better the way it is.\"\n\nRicciardo: \"We didn't have the Friday pace, little disappointed to miss out on a win but I am still grateful with another podium.\n\n\"I watched the chaos unfold in front of me. It was probably good that I had a bad start. It looked like three tried to go into one. I don't know whose fault it was.\"\n\nBottas: \"The car was working better than expected and I was just waiting for opportunities. I struggled in the wet but in the dry it was pretty good. There are still plenty of races to come and plenty of opportunities. Sebastian Vettel is my next target.\"","author":"BBC Sport","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T14:07:17.000Z"},"source":"bbc-sport","urlToImage":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/B859/production/_97839174_hamilton.jpg","digest":"hYSVETI18JG6wyi8ryb0nw==\n"}

We could have won but overall it was an intense, disciplined and battling game.\n\n\"We are not in a transfer period and on the day we played Liverpool that affected us. We are all human beings. If you play 55 games a season you can have a bad performance.\n\n\"We had a bad record recently here and they are strong at home. But we showed solidarity and that was very good. We didn't hide when we had the ball and this is a good basis to build on for future games.\"\n\nThe draw was a fully deserved reward for an excellent display that could even have brought victory against the Premier League champions, who finished with 10 men following the late dismissal of David Luiz for a high tackle on Sead Kolasinac.\n\n\"I don't like to comment about the referee,\" said Chelsea manager Antonio Conte. \"We have great respect for officials, but it is strange to finish a third game in a row against Arsenal with 10 men.\"\n\nThe point leaves Chelsea third in the table, three points behind Manchester City and Manchester United.\n\n\"It was a good, open game with both teams trying to win,\" added Conte. \"Every game against Arsenal is always very tough. We knew very well what type of game we would face. Both teams are great teams - it's a good draw.\"\n\nPedro missed Chelsea's best chance in the first half when he raced clear but was blocked by Arsenal keeper Petr Cech.\n\nArsenal, however, had arguably the better opportunities as Danny Welbeck headed wide from in front of goal and Aaron Ramsey struck a post, Alexandre Lacazette firing the rebound over an open goal.\n\nThe second period was a tighter affair, the Blues' frustrations boiling over in the closing minutes when Luiz was shown red for his reckless challenge on Kolasinac.\n\nExcellent Arsenal show real steel\n\nWenger insisted the debacle of the loss at Liverpool in August - a performance that provoked fierce criticism of both manager and players - was an \"accident\".\n\nThe words were greeted with cynicism by those who had been at the scene of identical Arsenal 'accidents' at Anfield three times in the past four years and wondered whether Wenger was again at odds with the reality of the Gunners' plight.\n\nArsenal's display on Sunday, full of steel and discipline as well as attacking intent, gave the Frenchman's theory plenty of weight as they stood toe-to-toe with the champions and were the better side for spells.\n\nThe trick now is for Arsenal to provide further evidence that this excellent performance - at a ground which has been a stage of unrelenting misery is recent years - is the rule and the display at Anfield is the exception.\n\nWenger's team selection was an improvement on the fiasco of Anfield, where Lacazette and Kolasinac were inexplicably left out when threat and physical presence were essential.\n\nArsenal's manager cut an agitated figure in his technical area for much of the game, spending time in dialogue with the officials nearby, but there was much for Wenger to be satisfied with as they more than matched Chelsea.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Wenger pleased with 'intense, disciplined' draw\n\nLuiz continues Mane debate\n\nLuiz was shown a straight red card for his challenge on Kolasinac near the touchline with only three minutes left.\n\nAnd yet the Brazil international may have feared dismissal earlier in the half when his flying overhead kick caught Laurent Koscielny near the face in the penalty area - before referee Michael Oliver issued a yellow card.\n\nThe incident revived the debate sparked by Sadio Mane's dismissal for Liverpool at Manchester City last Saturday, when his high boot injured keeper Ederson.\n\nSocial media was instantly alive, especially with Reds fans highlighting what they regarded as an injustice.\n\nJon Moss was the referee at Etihad Stadium and was clearly implementing the law that says: \"Serious foul play - a tackle or challenge that endangers the safety of an opponent or uses excessive force…\"\n\nOliver clearly deemed this not to be the case with Luiz's challenge on Koscielny - but it will not stop the debate.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Chelsea disciplinary record not an issue - Conte\n\nChelsea left frustrated\n\nThe Blues have recovered impressively with four straight wins after the opening-day home defeat by Burnley - but Stamford Bridge was seething with frustration at the final whistle here.\n\nArsenal were clearly the happier side, although they will feel irritated they could not get three points as Chelsea were kept out with a performance containing a resilience the Gunners are often accused of lacking.\n\nPedro wasted Chelsea's best chance, while Alvaro Morata showed plenty of good touches but also a willingness to go to ground too easily under physical challenges.\n\nThe hosts' mood was summed up by Conte's animated fury in the closing moments, especially after Luiz's red card.\n\nIt was not the best of the days for the champions.\n\nMan of the match - Shkodran Mustafi\n\nShkodran Mustafi had a header chalked off for offside in the second half and the Arsenal defender produced a game-high eight clearances\n\nConte sees a goal drought for the first time\n\nChelsea failed to score in a competitive home match under Conte for the first time (27 games).\n\nThe last time that they failed to net in a competitive game at Stamford Bridge was in April 2016 against Manchester City when Guus Hiddink was in charge - 29 games ago.\n\nThis was the first 0-0 draw between these two sides at Stamford Bridge since April 2005 and the first time that Chelsea have failed to score at home against the Gunners since then.\n\nArsenal have now failed to score in eight of their past 14 trips to Chelsea.\n\nChelsea have been given as many red cards in their past five Premier League games (three) as they had in their previous 73.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nChelsea face Championship side Nottingham Forest in the EFL Cup on Wednesday (19:45 BST kick-off), before returning to Premier League action against Stoke on Saturday (15:00).\n\nArsenal are also in EFL Cup action on Wednesday as they welcome Doncaster Rovers of League One to Emirates Stadium (19:45), before hosting West Brom on Monday, 25 September in the league (20:00).","author":"BBC Sport","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T16:58:27.000Z"},"source":"bbc-sport","urlToImage":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/FCC0/production/_97840746_wnger.jpg","digest":"B29y+1lQENLIAs+Ukrrakw==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"59bf20fd1a5b11e78041385e"},"description":"Which club has three players in Garth Crooks' team of the week? And which Arsenal man is built like a 'brick toilet'?","title":"Garth Crooks' team of the week: Aguero, Jesus, De Bruyne, Valencia, Kolasinac","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41301493","text":"Manchester City and Manchester United both maintained their winning starts to the season with big victories, City moving top after a 6-0 demolition of Watford with United joining them after a 4-0 win over Everton.\n\nRoy Hodgson got off to a shaky start at Crystal Palace with a 1-0 defeat against Southampton, while Arsenal picked up their first point at Chelsea in six seasons after a 0-0 draw on Sunday.\n\nLiverpool were held to a 1-1 draw by Burnley, Newcastle beat Stoke, and Bournemouth got off the mark for the season with a late 2-1 win over Brighton.\n\nTottenham and Swansea, and West Ham and West Brom had to settle for goalless draws while Huddersfield took a point against Leicester.\n\nYou can see the thinking behind my team below but, first, have a go at picking your own team of the week.\n\nYou can pick your own team of the week from the shortlist selected by BBC Sport journalists and share it with your friends.\n\nIf you can't see the selector, please use this link to pick your XI.\n\nGoalkeeper - Nick Pope (Burnley)\n\nNick Pope made eight saves in Burnley's 1-1 draw at Liverpool, the joint-most of any goalkeeper in the Premier League this weekend, along with Lukasz Fabianski\n\nNick Pope was unlucky not to make my team of the week after his performance against Crystal Palace last weekend, when he came on for the injured Tom Heaton and did an excellent job under immense pressure.\n\nAgainst Liverpool, buoyed by their Champions League return in midweek, Pope looked like a goalkeeper competent enough to play in the Champions League himself.\n\nHis first save from Emre Can was a tricky one, especially travelling at such speed, but the stop from Daniel Sturridge must have given the keeper a lot of confidence.\n\nHowever, it was the save from Trent Alexander-Arnold that did it for me. The youngster was looking for his first Premier League goal and Pope had no intention of giving it to him. It was a wonderful save. Jurgen Klopp was absolutely right to congratulate Pope after the game. It was an outstanding first Premier League start.\n\nDefender - Jamaal Lascelles (Newcastle)\n\nAll four of Jamaal Lascelles' Premier League goals have been headers from corners.\n\nIt's absolutely buzzing at St James' Park at the moment and I'm not surprised with Jamaal Lascelles leading their charge.\n\nTheir captain looks a real danger on set-pieces for Newcastle - scoring against Swansea last weekend - and so it proved again as he towered above the Stoke defence to nod home the winner.\n\nIt was ironic that Lascelles found himself remonstrating with referee Stuart Attwell about his refusal to award the Magpies a penalty just before that. I must say I agreed with Attwell - Kurt Zouma did make contact with the ball.\n\nHowever, it was from the ensuing corner kick that Lascelles got his rewards. He should have scored earlier in a similar situation but put too much into the header.\n\nThis is heroic stuff from these Newcastle lads but be sure they will soon run out of gas. It is imperative that Rafa Benitez is allowed to continue developing this team in January because this bubble will burst.\n\nDefender - Joel Matip (Liverpool)\n\nSince making his Premier League debut in August 2016, Liverpool have won 59% of the games in which Joel Matip has started, compared to 44% when he hasn't.\n\nJoel Matip is a very willing defender and without the Cameroon international's exploits against Burnley, Liverpool would almost certainly have lost.\n\nHis header off the line from a Ben Mee effort was priceless for the Reds. If that wasn't enough, Mee nearly gave the Kop another heart attack when Simon Mignolet just about managed to stop the ball crossing the line after the Burnley defender had happily accepted another free header at the far post.\n\nHowever, it was Matip, acting as his goalkeeper's insurance policy, who saved the day. I've expressed my views about Liverpool's defence on a number of occasions and they were desperately lucky to survive this fixture.\n\nLiverpool fans can continue to argue all they want about their goals-against record at Anfield but that is totally misleading. I will say this: Matip is an honest competitor capable of producing excellent performances on his day. But for goodness sake, he needs a defence around him.\n\nDefender - Shkodran Mustafi (Arsenal)\n\nOnly Nacho Monreal (21) has made more clearances than Shkodran Mustafi (16) for Arsenal in the Premier League this season.\n\nAt first glance, it looked like a perfectly good goal against Chelsea and, had it been allowed, Arsenal and Shkodran Mustafi would have deserved it on the balance of play.\n\nMustafi didn't give Alvaro Morata a kick throughout the entire 90 minutes of Sunday's London derby. Granted, Morata could have done with a little help from Willian, who couldn't seem to cope, having played two games in four days.\n\nThat is an important point. because if Chelsea intend to progress in the Champions League, and be serious contenders to retain the title, then more of their players are going to have to deal with playing in midweek and picking up valuable points in the league at the same time.\n\nManchester City have proved they are capable of producing victories after Champions League fixtures, and have the appetite to score goals. Arsenal played in the Europa League two days after Chelsea's European game and somehow looked better for it.\n\nThe Gunners now seem over their nightmare at Anfield of a few weeks ago and if Mustafi, Laurent Koscielny and Sead Kolasinac can stay fit, Arsenal's chances of finishing in the top four will improve dramatically.\n\nWing-back - Antonio Valencia (Manchester United)\n\nAntonio Valencia (left) has won all 12 of the home Premier League games in which he's scored for Manchester United.\n\nHe doesn't score many goals these days but this one, for Manchester United against Everton, was worth the wait. Antonio Valencia hit the ball with such force that Jordan Pickford was still in the air when it hit the net. It was an absolute corker.\n\nEverton, especially Wayne Rooney, made it difficult for United. It was strange seeing Rooney playing against his old team, nevertheless United had to take their former captain very seriously.\n\nRooney at his sharpest might have had a hat-trick in this game. On this showing, I'm not entirely sure why Mourinho didn't insist the former England international stay at Old Trafford for one more season. He clearly still has goals in him.\n\nPerhaps one of the reasons Mourinho decided to let Rooney go was because he had a fast-developing Marcus Rashford in his ranks. The lad can score goals and has terrifying pace.\n\nHe also has a ready-made captain in Valencia. Two for the price of one, you might say, but that didn't stop the United fans giving Rooney a marvellous standing ovation - quite rightly - when he was substituted in the 82nd minute.\n\nMidfielder - Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City)\n\nKevin De Bruyne has made more assists than any other player in the Premier League since his Manchester City debut in September 2015 (30).\n\nHow does the smallest man on the park score the best headed goal of the game? Delivery - that's the secret.\n\nSergio Aguero is nothing without the delivery of the pass and Kevin De Bruyne's quality of pass is as good as it gets. The king of the assists was at it again against a Watford side outclassed, outgunned and beaten out of sight by Manchester City.\n\nWhen you consider the way City demolished Feyenoord in the Champions League in midweek and then comfortably dispatched Watford three days later, it tells you a number of things.\n\nFirstly, City are growing as a squad, secondly, they can cope with the demands of Champions League football and the Premier League at the same time, and thirdly, every single Manchester City player looks desperate to get on the scoresheet.\n\nThat performance must have scared the hell out of Jose Mourinho. It certainly surprised the hell out of me.\n\nMidfielder - Mario Lemina (Southampton)\n\nAt 90%, Mario Lemina has the best passing accuracy of any Southampton player in the Premier League this term.\n\nMy goodness, this lad looks a powerhouse.\n\nI suppose when you've played for one of the biggest clubs in the world, you should have all the tools to survive in any league. However, what I witnessed in Southampton's Mario Lemina was a player who seemed to stifle Crystal Palace's every move.\n\nThe former Juventus man was composed on the ball and timely in the tackle - and for a holding midfielder, he was very capable of hurting the opposition.\n\nLemina is a top-four player in my opinion and fair play to Southampton for making the purchase. Why he is not playing for Liverpool or Arsenal is a mystery to me.\n\nCrystal Palace, meanwhile, have issues. I have a soft spot for the Eagles; their fans are fantastic and the club give homegrown talent a chance to develop - they are a wonderful club.\n\nBut to stay in the Premier League, their players need to be fitter and show a lot more courage when in possession of the ball. Only then will their confidence return.\n\nThey have already seen off one decent man in Frank de Boer. To do the same to Roy Hodgson would be unforgivable.\n\nWing-back - Sead Kolasinac (Arsenal)\n\nNo Arsenal player has more assists (two) than Sead Kolasinac in the Premier League so far this season\n\nSead Kolasinac is built like one of those North London brick toilets that withstood bombing raids during the Second World War.\n\nEven after the most awful tackle by my defender of the year last season, David Luiz, he rose to his feet determined to finish the game.\n\nThe way Luiz overran the ball in an attempt to draw Kolasinac into the challenge left me in no doubt that the Chelsea defender knew exactly what he was doing. In my view, he wanted a piece of Kolasinac.\n\nIn my playing days, both men would have received a standing ovation for a tackle like that - Luiz for throwing down the gauntlet and Kolasinac for accepting it.\n\nEven though the Arsenal defender came off worst, the impressive Bosnia-Herzegovina international finished the game and with it earned a moral victory.\n\nThis is the third consecutive game in which Chelsea have had a man sent off against Arsenal, which begs the question: are the Blues capable of retaining their discipline against the Gunners, especially when they appear to have the upper hand?\n\nForward - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\n\nNo Liverpool player has been involved in more goals than Mohamed Salah in the Premier League so far this season (four)\n\nWhat a hit Mohamed Salah is turning out to be at Liverpool. A total of five goals in seven starts since his arrival at Anfield tells you that the Egypt international is enjoying his football on Merseyside.\n\nI didn't think this was an earth-shattering performance against by the Reds against Burnley by any means. In fact, there was a lot about this game that lacked fizz.\n\nLike Spurs and Chelsea, they played in the Champions League in midweek, and all three teams were unable to take maximum points at home on their return to league duties.\n\nNevertheless, Jurgen Klopp has Philippe Coutinho back in his ranks. If the Brazilian's head is not in Barcelona, then he, along with Sadio Mane and Salah, could give Liverpool fans a real treat this season - especially in the Champions League. I've said enough about the Liverpool defence.\n\nForward - Sergio Aguero (Manchester City)\n\nSergio Aguero has scored in eight consecutive away Premier League starts.\n\nI have to go back to the days of Manuel Pellegrini managing Manchester City to recall Sergio Aguero looking so menacing.\n\nThe Argentine also looks very happy. Could it have something to do with this genuine world-class finisher having another competent striker to play alongside him and share the load?\n\nAguero and Gabriel Jesus are looking formidable together and are developing a striking partnership I've not seen since the days of Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole - and we all know what they accomplished.\n\nIt was his third goal against Watford that really blew me away and reminded me of the final phase of that phenomenal run by his countryman and relative Diego Maradona against England in 1986.\n\nThe way Aguero waltzed past Etienne Capoue and Abdoulaye Doucoure was astonishing, then Jose Holebas and Christian Kabasele got burnt by Aguero's change of pace, leaving Adrian Mariappa watching helplessly. This was just genius at work.\n\nIt was Aguero's sixth hat-trick in the Premier League and his 10th for City. Now tell me that's not world class.\n\nForward - Gabriel Jesus (Manchester City)\n\nGabriel Jesus has been directly involved in 15 goals in 15 Premier League appearances for Man City.\n\nThe sign of a good player is when the opposition identify the threat and try to eliminate that threat, but to no avail.\n\nThat was clearly the intent of Watford's Jose Holebas and Daryl Janmaat as they tried to exact their own form of physical presence on Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus. The perfect response from Jesus was to answer those bully-boy tactics with goals.\n\nThe Brazilian is finding his way very quickly in the Premier League. His development, and his partnership with Sergio Aguero, could make the difference in helping Manchester City take the title away from my favourites this season, Manchester United.\n\nThere is no other team in the league who are playing anything quite like it at the moment.\n\nFinally, all those red-faced soothsayers and doomsday merchants who condemned two up-front as a formation for a bygone age had better think again. If it was good enough for Real Madrid legends Ferenc Puskas and Alfredo Di Stefano, then it is good enough for anyone.","author":"BBC Sport","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T20:21:02.000Z"},"source":"bbc-sport","urlToImage":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/13D3E/production/_97841218_gettyimages-847864710.jpg","digest":"2ScFfF7XYhwW+ntjUO7b5g==\n"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bf210a1a5b11e780413865"},"description":"Another wet masterclass from Lewis Hamilton proves nice guys prevail in F1, as Sebastian Vettel's approach costs Ferrari dearly.","title":"Singapore Grand Prix: Has Sebastian Vettel's aggression just cost him the title?","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/41301477","text":"Ferrari were expected to dominate in Singapore - but it was all over on the first lap\n\nHow much will Sebastian Vettel come to regret the aggressive defensive move that contributed to the collision that took him out of the Singapore Grand Prix?\n\nIt is something of a signature move of Vettel's. He has used it to great effect in the past. He may well have learned it from his hero Michael Schumacher, who also specialised in that sort of uncompromising lunge. Usually it works to his advantage - but this time it could have cost him a world championship.\n\nThat is not to say the Ferrari driver was wholly or even primarily to blame for the incident that also accounted for his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen and Red Bull's Max Verstappen. There were and will be lots of differing opinions about that.\n\nBut Verstappen had a point when he said that, as a contender in a tight fight for the title, Vettel \"shouldn't take those risks\".\n\nIt is easy to say that, especially when you are the only other person who could be blamed for the incident. How should a title contender behave in these scenarios? Can they afford to be more conservative than normal? Or is that a potential risk in itself?\n\nThis is an example of the fine margins Formula 1 drivers are dealing as they battle wheel to wheel at speeds approaching 200mph, and the split-seconds they have to make their decisions.\n\nThose fine margins were clear at the first corner. Lewis Hamilton chose the outside line on his Mercedes and stayed out of trouble, slotting in behind Vettel and soon moving into a lead he was not to surrender, and which gave him a commanding lead in the championship over Vettel.\n\nJust behind him, McLaren driver Fernando Alonso had done the same. The Spaniard was poised to slot into third place behind Vettel and Hamilton after a trademark flying start, and for a brief instant was dreaming of his and McLaren-Honda's first podium. Then he was collected by Raikkonen's wildly spinning Ferrari, and just like that his hopes evaporated.\n\nHave Vettel's for the title just gone the same way? Mercedes and Hamilton were keen to emphasise after the race that nothing had changed, they had to retain focus, there were a lot of points still to play for, a lot of things could happen and so on.\n\nBut there was no doubting that Hamilton realised what this meant.\n\n\"Time will tell,\" he said. \"But it is a very positive day. I had no idea it would be such a positive outcome. I need to hit hard in the next two races and - game on.\"\n\nGame on indeed.\n\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen blamed Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel for the first-lap crash, which took out three cars\n\nThe Vettel incident\n\nIn the paddock afterwards, opinion was split on who was to blame for the start-line incident. Some felt Vettel had been too aggressive in diving across to the left to defend against Verstappen. Others felt that Verstappen, as the man who had a clear view of both Ferraris, could have decided discretion was the better part of valour and backed out of it.\n\nIn the end, the stewards were probably right to take no action over the start-line incident, deciding that \"no driver was wholly or predominantly to blame\".\n\nVettel was undoubtedly very aggressive in covering against Verstappen. In normal circumstances, that would have been OK. He would have edged the Red Bull to the pit wall, they would have disputed the first corner and moved on from there.\n\nThe problem was that Vettel clearly did not realise team-mate Raikkonen was on Verstappen's inside and moving ahead, having made the best start of all three.\n\nRaikkonen kept his car arrow-straight, the only movements on his steering wheel to correct wheelspin in the wet conditions. Verstappen initially went right towards Vettel but quickly went back to the left, seeing Vettel coming across and Raikkonen on his inside.\n\nMcLaren's Fernando Alonso was also forced into early retirement after his car suffered damage\n\nAs Vettel kept coming, Verstappen soon had nowhere to go.\n\nThe initial touch that triggered the collision was the Red Bull's left front tagging Raikkonen's right rear, which spun the Finn around into Vettel.\n\nBut by the time that touch happened, Vettel was arrowing in rapidly towards the pair of them and Verstappen looked like he had nowhere to go.\n\nIt was just one of those things that can happen at the start of a grand prix, but there was no doubt who was the biggest loser.\n\nA mammoth task for Vettel now\n\nHamilton has now won three races in a row and Vettel's deficit is more than a clear race win. That's quite a turnaround from the German being 14 points in front after his victory in Hungary at the end of July.\n\nHamilton has serious momentum now, and of the circuits coming up there are no major headaches for Mercedes of the kind that Singapore was expected to be.\n\nMercedes are a little concerned about Mexico and Brazil, where they feel the characteristics may favour Ferrari and Red Bull. But by and large the fight should be pretty even.\n\nIf the season goes as it has so far, the competition will be close, but Hamilton will be on pole more often than not and probably win more than Vettel.\n\n\"It doesn't change much,\" Vettel said. \"I'm sure there will be more opportunities.\" There almost certainly will. But will there be enough, or will Singapore come to be seen as the race that decisively turned the championship in Hamilton's favour?\n\nOne of Hamilton's great wins\n\nIf Singapore does prove a defining moment in Hamilton's favour, it would only be appropriate - for it was one of his finest drives.\n\nMercedes were struggling, well off the pace of both Ferrari and Red Bull in practice and they arrived at the track on Sunday expecting a day of damage limitation. But then it started to rain.\n\nHamilton's wet masterclasses: At Silverstone in 2008 he finished more than a minute ahead of the field, and survived a puncture to win at a wet Monaco that year\n\n\"They were in another world in dry conditions,\" Hamilton said. \"For the rain to fall, I was so happy. You can't imagine how happy I was. Normally when it rains you are a little apprehensive. It is a little nerve-wracking because it makes it so much trickier for us and here we've never even driven in the rain.\n\n\"But I was kind of like: 'Yes!' When those conditions happen, it's more of a lottery. There's more opportunity, it levels the field.\n\n\"When that happened, I was like: 'It's on. I am dead certain we can do a very good job in terms of damage limitation and potentially even win.' I was convinced in my mind I was going to overtake everyone.\n\n\"They are my conditions. I felt if any part of my ability is going to shine it is going to be in the first laps in those conditions.\n\nFuji, Japan, 2007: Torrential rain couldn't stop rookie Hamilton as two-time world champion team-mate Fernando Alonso crashes out\n\n\"A bunch of them went missing. I think I did a good job to stay out of it all. Then I had the red bull behind me and it has been a quicker car all weekend and he had nothing on me. I had so much pace.\"\n\nIf that reads like bragging, Hamilton doesn't mean it like that. For him, it's just a stated fact. And in any case his career justifies such self-confidence. Time and again he has shone in those conditions and he did it again in Singapore.\n\nFastest lap followed fastest lap as he pulled away from the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo behind him and soon the race was totally under his control.\n\nJapan again - Suzuka: overtook title rival Rosberg around the outside at Turn One. But the win was overshadowed by the fatal crash to Jules Bianchi\n\nWhy the turnaround? Mercedes said they did not fully understand.\n\nUndoubtedly, part of it was the driver, but there were technical reasons, too. Hamilton was four seconds clear by lap six, but then Ricciardo started to run into gearbox problems that cost him in the region of half a second a lap.\n\nOn top of that, the rain lowered the track temperatures and that played into Mercedes' hands. \"We were running in an area where we had the temperatures always under control,\" said team boss Toto Wolff, \"and on Saturday it was hotter and in order to extract them on one lap you need to run them higher.\"\n\nHamilton was delighted to get what he accepted was an unexpected present, but said: \"I definitely won't change anything, because working the approach I have there is no reason to change it, It is a perfect balance of being aggressive and cautious at the same time. The formula works at the moment so just continue with it.\"\n\nSingapore 2017: supposed to struggle, but in the rain his rivals cannot get near him\n\nKubica still in frame for a return\n\nUntil the competitive action really got going, much of the focus in Singapore was off track, on the shape of team line-ups for next year.\n\nMercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull, Renault and Force India now have confirmed driver line-ups, after Mercedes re-signed Valtteri Bottas, Renault took Carlos Sainz on loan and Force India secured Sergio Perez. And it seems only a matter of time before Fernando Alonso puts pen to paper on a new contract with what will be McLaren-Renault for next season.\n\nThe intriguing team is Williams, where the name of Robert Kubica keeps cropping up as potential team-mate for Lance Stroll.\n\nWilliams are keeping their cards close to their chest, but it looks as if the Pole, trying to make a comeback after seven years out following his horrendous rally accident in 2011, could soon test for the team.\n\nKubica looked set to return for Renault - but all is not lost\n\nIt would be a sensible move from Williams. Their options are limited. They could yet retain Felipe Massa, but some in the team are asking whether that is a good idea. They have reserve driver Paul Di Resta as a back-up. Jolyon Palmer, who scored his career-best result on Sunday, is available after Renault dropped him, but they are not interested in him.\n\nRenault worked very hard to bring Kubica back, giving him three tests before deciding they could not be certain he would be ready by the time they needed to commit to a driver for 2018.\n\nWilliams, though, have more time - and their demands are perhaps not as great as those of a works team building towards a title challenge in a couple of year's time.\n\nKubica's final test for Renault in a 2017 car in Hungary cooled their interest. But did he not impress as much as hoped there because he will never be ready as a result of the limitations of his right arm, which has only partial movement? Or because he has not had the chance after so long out to build up the strength he needs to drive a modern F1 car?\n\nThe only way to find out is to test him - and conveniently Williams have a test programme with a 2014 hybrid car up and running, which they use to give Stroll experience.\n\nIt would be no surprise at all if Kubica was to test that car in the next few weeks.\n\nIf he does, and it doesn't work out, Williams will likely stick with Massa. But if Kubica is even somewhere close to the driver he was before, he would be a very interesting alternative - and the exposure Williams would get from bringing him back would be immense.","author":"BBC Sport","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T20:11:46.000Z"},"source":"bbc-sport","urlToImage":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/12182/production/_97841147_ferrari_rex3.jpg","digest":"yQbx3IpswdeO8vTROi1P7Q==\n"}

Their options when they did break were so limited.\n\nIn the opening 10 minutes, Manchester United (left, attacking from bottom to top) had plenty of touches in Everton's half - while the visitors (right) had none in the home side's half\n\nWayne Rooney, Tom Davies and Gylfi Sigurdsson are all good footballers - but they are not quick. Everton did not have runners in wide positions busting a gut to get upfield, or a centre-forward who could stretch the pitch.\n\nEarly on, Rooney was so deep he was always picking up the ball in his own half. He was always outnumbered and it was easy for United to win the ball back and put Everton back under pressure. There was no way out for them.\n\nRomelu Lukaku always allowed Everton to hit teams on the break, of course, but he was lining up against them on Sunday.\n\n'A goal to remind me of Maradona' Who makes Garth Crooks' team of the week?\n\nKoeman has got fast legs in his squad, in the likes of Kevin Mirallas and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, but they both started on the bench at Old Trafford.\n\nSo there might have to be a different way for Koeman to play, if he is going to stick with the same personnel.\n\nEverton played some good football against United and any tweak in team selection and style might mean that they do not keep the ball so well.\n\nIt would be worth it, though, if they got the ball up the pitch quicker and looked more dynamic in the final third.\n\nAt the moment, everything they do is pretty slow and every move has to be almost perfect for them to create a chance at the end of it.\n\nKoeman will find a way that works\n\nAt the start of the season Everton fans were very positive about the money they had spent and the signings they had made, but five weeks on things have gone a bit flat.\n\nWhether it is shots, shots on target or goals, Everton's numbers this season are just not good enough.\n\nPart of that is down to the opposition they have faced, of course. If the numbers are still the same after the next five games - when they have played some lesser teams - then they have got real problems.\n\nEverton's next three Premier League matches Saturday, 23 September Bournemouth (home) Sunday, 01 October Burnley (home) Sunday, 15 October Brighton (away)\n\nBut even taking who they have played into account, the Toffees have been disappointing.\n\nNot only are their attacking statistics down on their figures from the whole of last season, they also compare badly when you look at how they performed in the same five league fixtures they have just played against Stoke, Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United.\n\nEverton in 2017-18 compared to 2016-17 (vs same opposition) 2016-17 2017-18 Shots 48 42 Shots on target 21 10 Goals scored 4 2 Goals conceded 8 10 Points 6 4\n\nI don't think Evertonians will mind not winning any of those games against their last four opponents this time around, but they will feel their team should have had more of a go in them.\n\nThe way they are playing is a worry, but Koeman is a clever manager and he will be watching what is happening and learning - and he will find a way that works.\n\nBut it will not be easy. Other teams will be watching them and thinking that they will let Everton keep the ball because they are not going to be able hurt them doing that.\n\nRooney the only positive for Everton\n\nThe only real positive for Everton from Sunday's game was Wayne Rooney's performance on his return to his old club. I thought he was sensational.\n\nWayne Rooney returned to Old Trafford for the first time since leaving Manchester United in the summer\n\nRooney led the line on his own for much of the game, made chances and held the ball up brilliantly.\n\nHe could and should have scored too, but even that opportunity in the second half only came about through his own endeavour and creativity.\n\nPeople have questioned his commitment and his ability to perform at this level, but you only had to watch him in this game to see what he has to offer - and how hungry he still is - because he was absolutely brilliant.\n\nWayne Rooney had 72 touches against United - all over the pitch. \"That many touches playing away at Old Trafford is good if you are playing in the middle of the park, never mind up front\" said Murphy. \"That showed his willingness to get on the ball and his hunger to try to carry his team on. He was the one who got them back in the game in the second half and tried to make things happen, but he was doing so much on his own and it was difficult for him.\"\n\nHe was the shining light for Everton and I was disappointed for him that he did not score, because he deserved it.\n\nHis performance was something the other Everton players should look at and think 'that is the level we should be at'.\n\nOn its own, it is not enough, however.\n\nRooney has scored both his side's league goals this season but, as good as he still is, they cannot just rely on him to get them results.\n\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.","author":"BBC Sport","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T21:41:47.000Z"},"source":"bbc-sport","urlToImage":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/9CB2/production/_97841104_evertonstrikerwaynerooney.jpg","digest":"0f1KVZgnlBlZ2IzI2yoKqQ==\n"}

The storm, 140 miles (225 kilometers) east-northeast of Barbados, is intensifying, and hurricane warnings have been issued for the islands of Guadeloupe, Dominica, St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat.\n\nWatches are in place for locations including the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, St. Martin, Anguilla and St. Barthelemy -- all of which were devastated by Hurricane Irma earlier this month. Meanwhile, the Northeast U.S. is preparing for rain, beach erosion and riptides from a projected brush with offshore Hurricane Jose.\n\nMaria is the latest in a series of devastating storms that have battered the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico during the 2017 season. In the past month, hurricanes Irma and Hurricanes Harvey left dozens of people dead and upended energy and agriculture markets.\n\nMaria is traveling west-northwest at 15 mph and is forecast to move across the Leeward Islands on Monday night, according to an advisory published at 5 p.m. by the National Hurricane Center. Projections from forecasting service AccuWeather Inc. show Maria will probably become a Category 2 hurricane before reaching the Leeward Islands, and intensify once again to Category 3 as it nears Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on Wednesday. A Category 3 storm has maximum sustained winds above 110 mph.\n\nForecasters didn’t have enough data late Sunday to tell how Maria might affect the U.S. Jose, which is expected to stay off the coast of the Northeast U.S., probably will affect Maria’s path, according to Weather Underground of Ann Arbor, Michigan. While some models show Maria staying well off the U.S.’s eastern coast, others show it could pose a threat in about a week, the forecasting service said.\n\nDestruction on the French Caribbean island of Saint Martin on Sept. 16. Photographer: Helene Valenzuela/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIslands Prepare\n\nIn Puerto Rico, where Irma knocked out power to more than 1 million customers, officials set up 450 shelters, closed schools Monday, and planned to send government employees home at noon in advance of Maria.\n\nIn the nearby Dominican Republic, President Danilo Medina held an emergency meeting Sunday with officials from the armed forces and Center for Emergency Operations, before traveling to New York to attend the UN General Assembly meeting. Officials said they would monitor Maria’s progress and meet again Monday morning.\n\n“We are preparing for a powerful hurricane that will put even more pressure on our infrastructure already deeply affected by Hurricane Irma,” Carlos Mercader, a representative of Puerto Rico’s government in Washington, said in a statement.\n\nAfter the Storm, Someone has to Pay\n\nDominica, an island of 75,000 people in the eastern Caribbean, planned to shut schools, businesses and all government offices except emergency services Monday, said Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit in a national address.\n\n“We should not take this storm lightly. Just because the last one skipped us, we should not believe this one will skip us,” he said. “We ought to be mindful of the serious devastation caused in some of the islands” by Hurricane Irma.\n\nStorm Surge\n\nSkerrit ordered shelters to open and said the government would call for people in some areas to evacuate.\n\nStorm surge is expected to be a significant hazard and could raise water levels by as much as 4 feet to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) as it crosses the Leeward Islands, the hurricane center predicts. Swells, accompanied by life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, are already affecting islands across the Lesser Antilles, the hurricane center said.\n\nThe latest data on Jose show its threats to the U.S. have diminished, although an area from Fenwick Island, Delaware, to Sandy Hook, New Jersey, is under a tropical storm watch, according to the NHC’s 5 p.m. advisory.","author":"Simone Foxman, Michael Sasso, Ezra Fieser","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T21:30:32.732Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ixLE9F0I5VaI/v0/1200x849.jpg","digest":"mtQIE121nGs0mTHK2nA1EQ==\n"}

Now, founder Ray Dalio plans to share his management system and corporate culture with the world.\n\n“We’re about to take the algorithms we have, and we’re going to give them to others,” Dalio said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “We’re figuring out how to make that fit in a number of other companies, to just pass it along.”\n\nIt’s a radical turn for a radical firm. The billionaire leader of the world’s largest hedge fund has developed one of the more unusual approaches to management, and more recently turned them into computerized apps. There’s the Dot Collector, which employees use to rate one another on a grid visible to the entire firm; the Pain Button, used to record emotions like anger or frustration; and Baseball Cards, a summary of each employee’s strengths and weaknesses -- again, available for all at Bridgewater to see.\n\nSeveral large technology companies in Silicon Valley are eager to implement his ideas, said Dalio. He declined to name them and estimated the first roll-out is at least 18 months away.\n\n“In Silicon Valley there’s more of that notion that there’s a power in crowd-sourced decision-making and that it is idea-meritocratic,” said Dalio. “Traditional organizations are more challenged by that.”\n\nIn Dalio’s view, most companies are “dishonest” or “dysfunctional” because they don’t let employees speak freely and decision-making is often clouded by emotion or swayed by internal politics. While cautioning that he hadn’t studied them closely, he named Twitter Inc. and Netflix Inc. as two he admires.\n\nYears of secrecy have made Bridgewater the subject of fascination and skepticism. The firm’s practice of recording interactions among employees and encouraging junior staffers to criticize higher-ups in public drew comparisons to cult-like behavior, comparisons Dalio rejects.\n\n“It’s the reason for the success that I’ve had, that Bridgewater’s had,” he said. “This is not utopian. This is realistic.”\n\nRead more: In Dalio’s Quest to Outlive Himself, Principles to Become Law\n\nAcademics who studied Westport, Connecticut-based Bridgewater have praised its methods. Robert Kegan, a psychologist and professor at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education, identified Bridgewater as one of the few “deliberately developmental organizations.”\n\nManagement Decisions\n\nDalio, 68, details some of Bridgewater’s tools in his new book, “Principles,” which is being published this month. In it, he writes that he was motivated in part by Joseph Campbell’s studies in comparative mythology, specifically the final stage in a hero’s journey when the returning adventurer shares what he has learned.\n\nThe book also recalls the “breakthrough” moment in 2012 when Dalio realized Bridgewater could take the same approach to management decisions that it had taken for years with investment decisions: program them into computer algorithms.\n\n\"I am confident that it can be the same,\" Dalio told Bridgewater’s management committee in a Nov. 10, 2012, memo he called \"The Path Out: Systematizing Good Management.\" \"The only questions are whether it can happen fast enough and what will happen in the meantime.\"\n\nDalio is still figuring out exactly how to distribute his management tools. One thing he has decided: They won’t be a money-making business for Bridgewater.\n\n— With assistance by Saijel Kishan","author":"Erik Schatzker","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T21:00:00.007Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iD6UmljrOIXQ/v0/1200x887.jpg","digest":"/O3wx/JvrQftPEnTVBxkQg==\n"}

Trump, in a Sunday tweet, mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as “Rocket Man.”\n\nTillerson said the U.S. strategy is to pursue a “peaceful pressure campaign” based on what he called the four “nos”: not seeking either regime change or collapse in North Korea, an accelerated re-unification of the Korean peninsula, or a reason to send in military forces.\n\nThe UN has passed two rounds of sanctions against North Korea, which has continued nonetheless to advance its nuclear program and test its missile capabilities despite condemnation from the international community.\n\nFeeling the Pinch\n\nUN Ambassador Nikki Haley said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that Pyongyang is “already starting to feel the pinch” from the additional sanctions of more than $1 billion. “We have economically strangled North Korea at this point, and they have said as much,” she said.\n\nTrump told reporters on Sept. 12, after the latest Security Council sanctions vote, that sanctions were “not a big deal,” and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said on Sunday that there are doubts about whether economic measures will be enough to deter the regime. As a result, the U.S. must “make sure all options are under development,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\nMcMaster said Kim must relinquish his nuclear weapons because Trump won’t tolerate the threat. Asked whether he was saying the president will strike if Kim doesn’t end his nuclear program, McMaster said, “he’s been very clear about that, that all options are on the table.”\n\nHaley said Trump’s recent comment about raining “fire and fury” on North Korea wasn’t an empty threat, and that she’s “perfectly happy” having Defense Secretary James Mattis take over with military options if diplomacy fails.\n\nDiplomatic Remedies\n\n“We were being responsible by trying to use every diplomatic possibility that we could possibly do,” Haley said on CNN. “We have pretty much exhausted all the things that we could do at the Security Council at this point.”\n\n“If the United States has to defend itself or defend its allies in any way, North Korea will be destroyed,” she said.\n\nNorth Korea launches the intermediate range Hwasong-12 in this undated image released on Sept. 16. Photographer: Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP Photo\n\nDemocratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said she doesn’t think North Korea will give up its nuclear program, but that diplomatic remedies are still available. China might support a program with a verifiable freeze of North Korea’s missile program if it means “no regime change and no war,” she said.\n\n“North Korea is not going to give up its program with nothing on the table,” Feinstein said on CNN. Feinstein also said U.S. missile defense “isn’t perfect” and “I am concerned about the safety of the United States.”\n\nTillerson said on CBS that China, the principal supplier of oil to North Korea, can help exert pressure on Pyongyang by cutting off supplies, and that Russia can stop using 30,000 North Korean guest workers who send their wages home, propping up the economy.\n\nTrump said on Twitter Sunday that he spoke with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Saturday night and “Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!”\n\nMcMaster said the tweet appears to be a reference to North Korean leader because “that is where the rockets and missiles are coming from.”\n\nWatch This Next\n\nKim Jong Un: Nuke-Wielding Madman or Astute Dictator?\n\n— With assistance by Susan Decker, and Ben Brody","author":"Arit John, Mark Niquette","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T15:59:35.554Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/izmt_LmVSaRU/v0/1200x799.jpg","digest":"qZ0JEXHCndmvOk80+y14AQ==\n"}

The leak was found in a 170-kilometer pipeline connecting New Zealand’s only oil refinery north of Auckland with a terminal near the city’s airport.\n\nRefining NZ said the damaged section needs to be replaced. Initial estimates are that about 70,000 liters of jet fuel were lost and it will take 10 to 15 days to reopen the pipeline.\n\n“We’ve recovered all the fuel, so at least we’re not talking about an environmental issue today,” Refining NZ Chief Executive Sjoerd Post told Radio New Zealand Monday. “We are absolutely sorry to New Zealand and to Auckland that this is happening.”\n\nRefining NZ provisionally estimated the outage will cost as much as NZ$15 million ($11 million) in revenue from reduced pipeline income and reduced operation of parts of the refinery.\n\nZ Energy, the nation’s largest fuel company, said it is managing available supplies.

But they might care if their president acts like a career politician.","title":"Trump Takes a (Calculated) Risk on Immigration","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-09-17/trump-takes-a-calculated-risk-on-immigration","text":"Republican Representative Steve King of Iowa says that President Donald Trump will see his base “destroyed” if he agrees to provide legal status to illegal immigrants who came here as children, or at least if he does it without securing funding for a border wall. That’s bluster. But Trump is taking a political risk.\n\nIt’s true that some of Trump’s most prominent supporters are furious with him over the issue. But most voters have sympathy for the affected population and favor legal status. Most Republicans, too: A Morning Consult/Politico poll found that 69 percent of Republicans favored legal status.\n\nExit polling from the Republican primaries last year provides additional reasons for thinking that Trump will be in the clear if he supports legal status. Few of the Republicans who voted considered immigration their top issue: 15 percent in New Hampshire, 10 percent in South Carolina.\n\nIt’s true that those voters supported Trump by big margins. But he would have won the primaries without them, and they made up a minority of his total vote. (In South Carolina, for example, 15 percent of Trump’s voters considered immigration their top issue.)\n\nThe people who voted for Trump in the primaries are a reasonable definition of his political base. The evidence we have about them suggests that Steve Bannon doesn’t speak for them. We should have learned the lesson in April. Trump authorized air strikes against Syria, and many of his most vocal fans complained -- but it didn’t faze his voters.\n\nAn amnesty, even a limited one, could backfire on Trump anyway. There are Republican voters who don’t consider immigration their top issue and think that people who came here as children should be able to stay -- but also worry that our government has not taken the task of controlling immigration seriously. (There are non-Republicans who feel this way, too.)\n\nEven if a border wall is unpopular itself, Trump’s support for it and his refusal to back down from it in the face of criticism helped to establish that he would not cave in to this pressure. It was a symbol that he wasn’t weak like other politicians. He was tougher on illegal immigration.\n\nSome people who voted for him took him literally. They thought that if they voted for him, he would build a wall, maybe even with Mexican money. Others took him to be saying, I won’t flinch from doing what it takes.\n\nIf Trump held out the possibility of a limited amnesty to win Democratic support for some serious enforcement measures -- like requiring that employers use E-Verify to make sure their new hires are all legally in the U.S. -- then he could plausibly have said that he had delivered on the underlying message of his campaign rhetoric, even if not on all of its specifics.\n\nBut he’s not doing that. Instead, apparently impressed by the positive TV coverage he is getting for his bipartisanship and humanitarianism, he is insisting on the amnesty and being vague about the conditions. It looks less and less likely that he is going to get either a wall or E-Verify, the symbol or the substance.\n\nA segment of his voters might conclude that he wasn’t at all serious about illegal immigration -- and, for that matter, that he isn’t a great dealmaker and doesn’t tell it like it is, two other traits that distinguished him from career politicians in their eyes. The polls, most of the talking heads he watches and probably his relatives are all telling him he is doing something smart on immigration. He might be making a big mistake.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.","author":"Ramesh Ponnuru","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T14:00:08.494Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ifJjOVA8HF8o/v0/1200x828.jpg","digest":"rRGvtrhoobrbdlb/7C0wnA==\n"}

At the Bank of England, Mark Carney has cited cryptocurrencies as part of a potential “revolution” in finance.\n\nTo better understand the system, the Dutch central bank has created its own cryptocurrency, albeit for internal use only. U.S. officials are exploring the matter too, though in March Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell said there were “significant policy issues” that needed further study, including vulnerability to cyber-attack, privacy and counterfeiting.\n\nAccording to the BIS, one option for central banks might be a currency available to the public, with only the central bank able to issue units that would be directly convertible with cash and reserves. There might be a greater risk of bank runs, however, and commercial lenders might face a shortage of deposits.

In contrast, India will drive the third great wave of Asia’s growth – following Japan and China -- with a potential workforce set to climb from 885 million to 1.08 billion people in the next 20 years and hold above that for half a century.\n\n``India will account for more than half of the increase in Asia’s workforce in the coming decade, but this isn’t just a story of more workers: these new workers will be much better trained and educated than the existing Indian workforce,’’ said Anis Chakravarty, economist at Deloitte India. ``There will be rising economic potential coming alongside that, thanks to an increased share of women in the workforce, as well as an increased ability and interest in working for longer. The consequences for businesses are huge.’’\n\nWhile the looming ‘Indian summer’ will last decades, it isn’t the only Asian economy set to surge. Indonesia and the Philippines also have relatively young populations, suggesting they’ll experience similar growth, says Deloitte. But the rise of India isn’t set in stone: if the right frameworks are not in place to sustain and promote growth, the burgeoning population could be faced with unemployment and become ripe for social unrest.\n\nDeloitte names the countries that face the biggest challenges from the impact of ageing on growth as China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Thailand and New Zealand. For Australia, the report says the impact will likely outstrip that of Japan, which has already been through decades of the challenges of getting older. But there are some advantages Down Under.\n\n``Rare among rich nations, Australia has a track record of welcoming migrants to our shores,” said Ian Thatcher, deputy managing partner at Deloitte Asia Pacific. “That leaves us less at risk of an ageing-related slowdown in the decades ahead.’’\n\nJapan’s experience shows there are opportunities from ageing, too. Demand has risen in sectors such as nursing, consumer goods for the elderly, age-appropriate housing and social infrastructure, as well as asset management and insurance.\n\nBut Asia will need to adjust to cope with a forecast 1 billion people aged 65 and over by 2050. This will require:\n\nRaising retirement ages: Encouraging this could help growth in nations at the forefront of ageing impacts.\n\nMore women in the workforce: A direct lever that ageing nations can pull to boost their growth potential.\n\nTaking in migrants: Accepting young, high-skilled migrants can help ward off ageing impacts on growth.\n\nBoosting productivity: Education and re-training to bolster growth opportunities offered by new technologies.\n\n— With assistance by Garfield Clinton Reynolds","author":"Michael Heath","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T22:29:03.969Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iLH381_M.HqY/v0/1200x797.jpg","digest":"9VYNCPQvZM++GFC5w3Bmmw==\n"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bf21501a5b11e780413890"},"description":"These days, it’s virtually impossible to become a bona fide monopoly on Wall Street.","title":"Wall Street's Trillion-Dollar Monopoly Has Repo Traders on Edge","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-17/wall-street-s-trillion-dollar-monopoly-has-repo-traders-on-edge","text":"These days, it’s virtually impossible to become a bona fide monopoly on Wall Street.\n\nBut that’s exactly what is happening in one vital part of the U.S. financial system, which has more than a few traders on edge.\n\nCome mid-2018, just one entity -- the Bank of New York Mellon Corp. -- will be responsible for ensuring almost two trillion dollars of securities financed by so-called repurchase agreements are cleared and settled each and every day. With its lone longtime rival, JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co., exiting the business, BNY Mellon began the process of moving over clients this summer.\n\nThe problem isn’t so much that BNY Mellon might abuse its position in what’s become a highly regulated, utility-like part of the repo market. After all, JPMorgan threw in the towel after post-crisis rules made the business costly and onerous. Instead, traders are worried that relying on a single bank for all clearing and settlement -- which involves checking every transaction is valid, transferring money from one account to another and safeguarding collateral backing each contract -- could mean big trouble if something goes wrong.\n\nAnd it’s hard to overstate how important the repo market is to modern American finance. The short-term loans, which dealers usually get by putting up U.S. government debt as collateral, serve a crucial role in day-to-day trading on Wall Street. Not only do repos support liquidity in the $14.1 trillion Treasury market, but the financing they provide also helps grease the wheels of trading in assets as varied as stocks, corporate bonds and currencies.\n\nThe repo market explained -- a QuickTake\n\nPoint of Failure\n\n“A single point of failure in the U.S. government-collateralized repo market, which is huge and is essentially the liquidity engine for the country, is a little bit unnerving just in itself,” said Adam Dean, managing director at Square 1 Asset Management. “It’s not an ideal situation.”\n\nRecall that it was widespread panic in the repo market which helped lead to the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and imperiled the financial system a decade ago. While the Federal Reserve has spearheaded efforts that have greatly reduced systemic risks in tri-party repo, having just one clearing bank has the potential to leave U.S. markets more vulnerable to everything from natural disasters and computer glitches to terrorism and cyberattacks.\n\nBrian Ruane, who oversees BNY Mellon’s securities clearance and tri-party collateral business, says the firm is leaving nothing to chance.\n\nThe bank, which had over 80 percent of the market even before JPMorgan decided to exit the business, has spent $100 million in recent years beefing up its technology -- which included upgrades to enable three-way trade confirmations and the automatic substitution of collateral within repo agreements -- to meet the Fed’s tougher requirements.\n\n‘Important Role’\n\nThat sum doesn’t include the “very sizable” investment the bank made to replace its three-decade-old clearing and settlement platform. And since JPMorgan’s announcement last year, Ruane says BNY Mellon has spent even more on improvements, without saying how much.\n\n“We understand the important role we play in the marketplace and are preparing ourselves to take on this greater capacity,” Ruane, a 22-year veteran at the bank, said in an interview from BNY Mellon’s office in downtown Manhattan. “A key focus is on building resiliency, by investing more in back-up, capacity, technology, processes and people.”\n\nThere’s also plenty at stake for BNY Mellon itself. Fees from clearing accounted for 12 percent of revenue last year, according to the bank.\n\nRead more about BNY Mellon’s new tech-savvy CEO\n\nFor years, regulators have prodded players in the industry to come up with ways to prevent potential troubles in repos (which still play an important role in the shadow banking system) from turning into a contagion that threatens broader financial markets, as they did in 2008.\n\nClearing banks ended the practice of extending intraday credit, which regularly exceeded a trillion dollars. Repo dealers now have to set aside more capital to protect themselves against potential losses. More contracts are now backed by government debt rather than mortgages or other risk assets.\n\nFire Sales\n\nNevertheless, the Fed says work still needs to be done to eliminate fire sales, which was a key risk during the financial crisis. Dealers and investors are still vulnerable to the kind of rapid, wholesale dumping of assets that sank Lehman, and the repo industry has yet to implement a solution.\n\nNow, JPMorgan’s impending exit is once again calling attention to the stability of the repo market.\n\n“In this day and age when we are looking for risk mitigation across a wide range of institutions, it’s much healthier for the marketplace to have numerous clearers involved,” said Christian Rasmussen, the global co-head of repo trading at UBS Group AG. “It mitigates any concentration risk.”\n\nFor its part, BNY Mellon recently set up a unit called BNY Mellon Government Securities Corp. to oversee its repo business and bolster governance. It will have a separate board that includes a number of independent directors.\n\n“We recognize the systemic importance of this market and welcome the steps that Bank of New York Mellon has taken,” Fed Governor Jerome Powell said last month. The Fed “will continue to have heightened expectations for Bank of New York Mellon as it becomes the sole provider of settlement services.”\n\nBetter Off?\n\nThe process hasn’t been easy. Because of the legal and technical complexities, Ruane says the bank has taken its time getting new clients up and running to ensure that everything runs smoothly. As of late July, BNY Mellon had moved just four of JPMorgan’s clients onto its platform. And for the time being, JPMorgan will still safeguard their collateral, though both banks expect a majority to make the switch to BNY Mellon in the future.\n\nNobody is suggesting that the current state of affairs is bulletproof. In the event where one clearing bank goes down, it could still take weeks for the other to pick up all the slack.\n\n“It’s not like a firm can just flick a switch and move from one to the other,” said Jeff Kidwell, the director of funding and direct repo at AVM LP, a broker-dealer based in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nDarrell Duffie, a Stanford University finance professor who has written extensively on the repo market, says that because of issues like its high fixed costs, clearing is one business that just might be better off as a monopoly. Having a single player do all the back-office work could increase efficiency and liquidity. That would be a positive in the Treasury market, which critics say has suffered as post-crisis rules have made it tougher to trade.\n\n“Fewer pipes required in the plumbing of the repo market should make things cheaper,” he said.\n\nHowever, Duffie added one small, but important caveat.\n\nThat’s all “assuming it doesn’t cause clearing fees to go up.”","author":"Liz McCormick","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T23:00:00.009Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/igiKQAC0JdFg/v0/1200x635.jpg","digest":"FFteOH9aWS1i73gsvmC8/g==\n"}

The ship is named for the senator’s father and grandfather. A collision off the coast of Japan in June between a U.S. destroyer and a cargo ship killed seven U.S. sailors.\n\n“When you really look at how much time they have at actual training and readiness, it’s continued to shrink,” McCain said. “We have accident after accident after accident.

The footage is edited to make it appear as though Clinton is hit in the back with a golf ball before her fall.\n\nThe tweet revealed a President still reverting to his old social media habits, namely, those likely to earn him quick criticism, less than two months after retired Gen. John Kelly took over as White House chief of staff.\n\nWhile Kelly has not sought to stop Trump from tweeting, he has encouraged the President to allow him to vet the tweets before posting them -- a request Trump has sometimes acquiesced to.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday about the President's tweet and whether Kelly was aware of it.\n\nA spokesperson for Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the tweet.\n\nFormer Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub, who repeatedly criticized the administration about potential conflicts of interest before resigning in July , slammed Trump for the retweet and said he reported it to Twitter for violating the social media platform's rules of conduct.\n\n\"The President of the United States just retweeted a video vignette that imagines him assaulting his political rival. The man is unfit,\" tweeted Shaub, who joined the ethics office as a staff attorney early during the George W. Bush administration and was appointed as the office's director by President Barack Obama.\n\nThe President of the United States just retweeted a video vignette that imagines him assaulting his political rival. The man is unfit. pic.twitter.com/ETXrs4JwGY — Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) September 17, 2017\n\nThe tweet, which came as Trump prepares to head to New York for a critical round of powerhouse diplomacy with world leaders at the United Nations, followed a week during which Clinton reemerged in the spotlight as she promoted her new book, \"What Happened,\" about the 2016 campaign, reviving her fiercest criticisms of Trump and his supporters and reigniting the debate about her stunning, unanticipated loss.\n\nTrump slammed Clinton over her new book earlier this week too, tweeting that she \"blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss.\"\n\nTrump's Sunday morning Twitter post was one of more than a half-dozen supporters' tweets the President retweeted Sunday before 8:30 a.m.\n\nThose other tweets included an image predicting Trump would win every state for reelection in 2020, another showing Trump hauling US companies that have outsourced manufacturing abroad and a tweet claiming that \"only true Americans can see that president Trump is making America great.\"\n\nSouth Korea call\n\nTrump also took to Twitter Sunday morning to tweet about his call late Saturday night with South Korean President Moon Jae-in to discuss the ongoing tensions with North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\n\"I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing,\" Trump tweeted, appearing to offer a new moniker for North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. \"Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!\"\n\nBoth leaders' offices said Trump and Moon pledged during their call to work with the international community to ramp up pressure on the North Korean regime, which has so far been undeterred in advancing its nuclear and ballistic missile program despite a tightening of international sanctions.\n\nTrump's retweeting spree also came on the heels of a week during which he drew criticism from pockets of his political base as he signaled he was close to a deal with Democrats to protect undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children, known as \"Dreamers,\" from deportation in exchange for border security measures but not funding for the border wall at the center of his campaign.\n\nTrump has promised to rescind protections for those undocumented immigrants and said during the campaign they would have to be deported. Grassroots conservative supporters of the President also fumed that Trump would grant legal status to those undocumented immigrants without securing funding for the border wall, which he continues to promise will be built despite a lack of support in Congress.","author":"Jeremy Diamond, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T19:27:13.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170917084446-trump-golf-ball-hillary-clinton-tweet-ip-00000000-super-tease.jpg","digest":"x4JqBqSqEEqLBecJcbDEBw==\n"}

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) On Sunday morning, President Donald Trump retweeted a video that was edited to make it look like he was hitting a golf ball into the back of his 2016 election rival, Hillary Clinton, and knocking her down.\n\nKara S. Alaimo\n\nIt undoubtedly had the effect he wanted with some twisted sliver of his base: they paid attention and loved it. But it also had another effect he likely did not want: a much broader audience -- of his base, and beyond -- also paid attention and had a very different takeaway.\n\nLet's begin with the nastiest, most offensive aspect of this -- the knocking-a-woman-to-the-ground aspect. Viewed through the lens of his previous actions and statements -- for example, his acknowledgment that \"you know, I retweet, I retweet for a reason\" -- his Sunday retweet reads like this: the President thinks violence against women is funny.\n\nIn fact, any man who thinks it's hilarious to intentionally aim to hit a woman belongs with a psychotherapist, at best, not in the White House. Violence against women, President Trump, is never funny.\n\nAnd, whether or not this was Trump's intent, there's good reason not to promote even \"joke\" violence. Many studies have found that people who view violence in the media are significantly more likely to commit acts of physical aggression against others. In fact, many researchers say the risk of exposure to violence leading to actual violence is, as some have put it, as great as the risk of exposure to secondhand smoke from cigarettes leading to lung cancer.\n\nRead More","author":"Kara Alaimo","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T21:06:31.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170917125519-trump-golf-ball-gif-hillary-clinton-super-tease.jpg","digest":"9oRKx3FETq0Pw3b4t0DO1w==\n"}

And it affects how world leaders perceive the United States, too.","title":"Brian Stelter: Why newsrooms must keep fact-checking Trump","url":"http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/17/media/brian-stelter-trump-fact-checking/index.html","text":"I didn't think we'd have time for this segment on Sunday's \"Reliable Sources.\" We already had more than an hour's worth of media stories to cover. So I didn't think we'd have time to cover President Trump's latest errors and exaggerations.\n\nBut in our show meeting on Saturday, we decided we would make the time. And that was the point of this segment -- journalists must keep making time to point out Trump's fact-free assertions.\n\nWhy? Because the Trump White House's credibility crisis affects the country every day. And it affects how world leaders perceive the United States, too. We saw that this week when British prime minister Theresa May scolded Trump.\n\nHere are a few examples. On Thursday morning, the president promoted his decision to seek a deal with Democrats about DACA by saying, \"Look, 92% of the people agree on DACA.\"\n\n\"92%?\" While polls indicate that most Americans want \"Dreamers\" to remain in the country, no poll backs up Trump's \"92%\" claim. It sounded made up out of thin air.\n\nThat was Thursday morning. The president then went to Florida, toured damage from Hurricane Irma, and flew home. And that evening, he misspoke about the storm.\n\n\"In Florida, you got hit with the strongest winds ever recorded,\" he said at a reception. \"It actually hit the Keys with a -- it was a Category 5. I never even knew a Category 5 existed.\"\n\nIrma was actually a Category 4 storm when it hit the Keys, not a Category 5. Florida did not experience the \"strongest winds ever recorded.\"\n\nRelated: Stelter podcast with James Fallows\n\nI know this sounds nitpicky to some people, like it's no big deal. But it is a big deal to the scientists and meteorologists who study this for a living and try to keep people safe.\n\nThe Miami Herald, which was in Irma's path, wrote about Trump's misstatement. But I had a hard time finding many other fact-checks.\n\nThere are dozens of excellent fact-checkers in newsrooms across the country, but there's so much to fact-check and a limited amount of time.\n\nThis next example, Trump's Friday morning tweet about \"loser terrorists\" who set off a bomb on a train, got more attention. Trump said they were \"in the sights of Scotland Yard,\" less than half an hour after a guest on \"Fox \u0026 Friends\" suggested something similar.\n\nThe British government objected to Trump's claim. \"I never think it's helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation,\" May told reporters.\n\nRelated: Trump attacks ESPN after anchor calls him a white supremacist\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump will address other world leaders at the United Nations. His audience is well aware that he has credibility problem -- that he's prone to errors and exaggerations when he speaks.\n\nThat's one of the key reasons why journalists have to stay on this story.\n\nIt's easy to say \"Trump's fibs and flubs are old news by now.\"\n\nWhen he seemingly makes up a statistic, there's a tendency to think, \"that's just Trump being Trump.\"\n\nBut his slip-ups and screw-ups have far-reaching effects.\n\nEach individual misstatement may not amount to much. (Though I would argue many of them do.) But it's really about the pattern.\n\nFor example, a pattern of sloppiness makes Trump's social media team vulnerable to punchline status. On Friday the White House made a web video wishing the Air Force a happy 70th birthday. The @realDonaldTrump Twitter handle tweeted it out. But then pilots started replying to the president, pointing out that the plane shown at the very beginning does not belong to the Air Force. It's a Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet flown by the Navy.\n\nThe next day, Trump tweeted his endorsement of Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette in the Republican primary for governor. But he misspelled Schuette's name. On Sunday, Trump or someone on his team posted a corrected version.\n\nRemember when Trump said this in the wake of Charlottesville?\n\n\"When I make a statement, I like to be correct,\" he said.\n\nAnd: \"Before I make a statement, I need the facts.\"\n\nUntil that's actually true, newsrooms really do need to cover Trump's misstatements. It's not \"old news.\" Journalists from national networks to weekly papers need to keep making time for the facts.","author":"Brian Stelter","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T06:15:33.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170917180527-donald-trump-hurricane-irma-780x439.jpg","digest":"KFZwTg7C8FZzoLJQ/1ykZw==\n"}

The audience is counting on you.”\n\nBeginning with last September’s season 42 premiere, Baldwin appeared in 15 episodes as the eventual president. He earned rave reviews and helped bring renewed buzz and a ratings bump to the long-running sketch series.\n\nThe Emmy win marks Baldwin’s first since he went back-to-back in 2008 and 2009 for his portrayal of Jack Donaghy on 30 Rock, a role he was nominated for seven consecutive years. The actor’s gig on Match Game also scored him a nomination at last weekend’s Creative Arts Emmys for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program.\n\nBaldwin faced stiff competition in the category that included four past Emmy winners.

Sean Spicer, President Donald Trump’s former White House Press Secretary, shocked the celebrity audience and viewers at home when he rolled out his podium for a comedic bit. But the moment sparked a flurry of criticism with some even comparing it to Jimmy Fallon’s infamous hair tussle of Trump.\n\n“This is the largest audience to witness the Emmys, period. Both in person and around the world,” Spicer said as cameras honed in on reactions from his official SNL impersonator, Melissa McCarthy, and Veep‘s Anna Chlumsky. The comments spoofed his own comments in the White House when he misled press by proclaiming Trump’s inauguration had “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration — period — both in person and around the globe.”\n\nMany users posting to Twitter blasted the moment for attempting to “normalize” a man who spread lies during his time as press secretary.\n\n“Dear Sean Spicer: That did not absolve you from being on the wrong side of history,” one user wrote. “Saying you like Sean Spicer after one joke, and after all the havoc he has caused…you deserve to be smacked silly,” another tweeted. Another remarked, “Sean Spicer stood in the White House and lied to the American ppl. Bringing him on the Emmys is just as bad as Fallon ruffling Trump’s hair.”\n\nMany criticized Fallon for a similar situation during the 2016 presidential race when he interviewed Trump on The Tonight Show. “[People] have a right to be mad,” a “devastated” Fallon said of the backlash. “If I let anyone down, it hurt my feelings that they didn’t like it.

(Thrones has won 38 Emmys total, an industry series record.)\n\nFirst up during an opening skit, Colbert was joined by Black-ish star Anthony Anderson and Mom star Allison Janney, when this exchange happened:\n\nJanney: “Things are crazy out there. Sea levels are rising, our leaders are fighting, and I heard HBO is bringing back the Confederacy.”\n\nAnderson: “What? Aw hell no. I’m canceling my subscription! Well, as soon as Game of Thrones is done.”\n\nThat led into a bunch of gushing crosstalk about GoT capped by Janney blurting out praise for “Jon Snow’s butt.”\n\n(Confederate, of course, is HBO’s controversial upcoming series from the creators of Game of Thrones that imagines a modern-day America if the South had won the Civil War.)\n\nDuring the monologue, Colbert also told the celebrity crowd: “Don’t forget to thank everybody who helped you get here — namely Game of Thrones for not being eligible.”\n\nThen, after some praise for Netflix, Colbert circled back for another HBO joke: “Premium cable has a ton great shows. I’m sure HBO will take home a lot of Emmys tonight — which they’ll have to melt down to pay for next year’s hacker ransom.”\n\nYet Colbert through HBO plenty of love too.

Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n\nThe hour-plus weather delay in the first quarter only delayed the inevitable.\n\nElliott entered the game with a chance of setting an NFL record for most consecutive games with at least 80 yards rushing at 16. He left Denver with 8 yards on nine carries, easily the lowest mark of his brief career. Elliott’s previous low was 51 yards in last year’s season opener. His previous low-carry total was 12 against the Detroit Lions in Week 16.\n\nThe Cowboys, however, took Elliott out of the game early by calling passes on 10 of their first 15 plays.\n\nPrescott, who needed both ankles taped after a 7-yard scramble because of an awkward takedown at the end of the first quarter, threw two touchdown passes and was intercepted once, but Dez Bryant saved two turnovers by turning into a defensive back.\n\nPrescott attempted a career-high 50 passes and completed 30 for just 238 yards, but on his final attempt he was picked off by Aqib Talib, who returned the turnover 103 yards for the touchdown that led to the third-worst loss of the Jason Garrett era.\n\nWhat you need to know in the NFL\n\n• Statistics\n\n• Scoreboard\n\n• 2017 schedule, results\n\n• Standings\n\nDefensively, the Cowboys entered the game without Orlando Scandrick because of a broken hand, and by the second quarter they were without cornerbacks Nolan Carroll (concussion) and Chidobe Awuzie (hamstring). They had two healthy corners in Anthony Brown and rookie Jourdan Lewis, who was playing his first game.\n\nSiemian beat Lewis, who had four full practices all summer, for two of his touchdown passes. The last quarterback to throw four touchdown passes in a game against the Cowboys was Green Bay’s Matt Flynn on Dec. 15, 2013.\n\nThe Cowboys did not allow a 100-yard rusher last season, but C.J. Anderson became the first back to go for 100 yards against Dallas since current Cowboy Alfred Morris in the 2015 season finale when he played for the Washington Redskins.\n\nAfter giving up 233 yards and 13 first downs against the Giants in four quarters, they allowed 246 yards and 17 first downs in the first half Sunday. The Broncos converted on all eight of their third-down opportunities in the first half.\n\nThe good news for the Cowboys is they will get an extra day to prepare for their next game, Sept. 25 at the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nPrepare or recover, however you want to look at it.","author":"Todd ArcherESPN Staff Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-18T00:46:31.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0917%2Fr260052_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"cjrDtLcP2a7Qu6jHbSRRGg==\n"}

He was originally declared probable to return, but then declared out at the start of the second half. He was subsequently spotted on crutches, with a walking boot on his right foot.

Because of the injuries to Orlando Scandrick -- inactive because of a broken hand -- and Awuzie, the Cowboys are down to two corners: Anthony Brown and Jourdan Lewis.\n\nRob Kelley, RB, Washington Redskins: A rib injury knocked Kelley out of the game against the Rams; his original designation was questionable, but he was later downgraded to out. After the game, Redskins coach Jay Gruden revealed that Kelley has possibly fractured a rib.\n\nJoe Barksdale, OT, Los Angeles Chargers: Barksdale was knocked out of the game in the second half, although he did leave the field under his own power. Chris Hairston replaced Barksdale at right tackle.\n\nEric Reid, S, San Francisco 49ers: Reid sustained a left knee injury away from the play during the second quarter and was examined by the 49ers' medical personnel. He walked off the field under his own power and was deemed questionable to return. He did, in fact, return to the game, but left the game again after a big hit on Seahawks tight end Jimmy Graham. Reid returned again -- and left again, after re-injuring the knee. He remained sidelined thereafter.\n\nJimmy Graham, TE, Seattle Seahawks: Graham was hit at the end of a play during the first half and fell backwards awkwardly over a pile. He walked off under his own power but was taken to the medical tent for further evaluation. Graham returned to the game in the second half.\n\nT.J. Watt, LB, Pittsburgh Steelers: Watt suffered a groin injury in the first half against the Vikings and was originally declared questionable to return before being designated as out. After the game, Watt indicated that he didn't believe the injury was serious but would find out more in the coming days, per ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.\n\nJordan Howard, RB, Chicago Bears: Howard left Raymond James Stadium with his right arm in a sling after being listed on the injury report with a shoulder issue heading into Week 1.\n\nRob Gronkowski, TE, New England Patriots: Gronkowski headed into the medical tent along the sideline after taking himself out of the game following a third-quarter catch.

Gronk was declared questionable to return with a groin injury, but did not return.\n\nDeShone Kizer, QB, Cleveland Browns: A migraine knocked Kizer out of the Browns' contest vs. the Ravens, and he was declared questionable to return. Kizer completed 6 of 11 passes for 81 yards, but had an interception (on a throw off Duke Johnson Jr.'s hand) and a fumble lost on a sack. Kevin Hogan stepped in to replace him, but Kizer returned with 8:19 left in the third quarter.\n\nCorey Davis, WR, Tennessee Titans: Davis left Sunday's game with a hamstring injury, and Tennessee listed Davis as questionable to return.

He returned late in the second quarter.\n\nTrey Hendrickson, DE, New Orleans Saints: The rookie defensive end was injured in the first half while tackling Mike Gillislee and was attended to by medical personnel on the field. He then got up and walked slowly to the Saints' sideline before heading back to the locker room for further evaluation. He was declared questionable to return but did not.\n\nJeremy Maclin, WR, Baltimore Ravens: Maclin left the game after being tackled in the first quarter, and was examined for a left shoulder injury. He returned on the Ravens' next drive.\n\nJesse James, TE, Pittsburgh Steelers: James was injured on the first drive of the game for the Steelers' offense and was examined on the sideline. James returned on the Steelers' following possession.\n\nSam Bradford, QB, Minnesota Vikings: Bradford, who has been dealing with pain, swelling and discomfort in his left knee following Minnesota's Week 1 win over the Saints, was one of seven players the Vikings made inactive on Sunday. Bradford went through warm-ups shortly after 10 a.m. ET, during which he did not do much to test the strength of his left knee. Bradford did some light throwing and dropped back a few times on passes, but he did not run or exhibit much footwork at Heinz Field.\n\nBradford's left knee is the same one in which doctors repaired his torn ACL in 2013 and again in 2014. Backup Case Keenum will start in his place against Pittsburgh.\n\nThursday\n\nKevin Johnson, CB, Houston Texans: Johnson, the Texans' 2015 first-round pick, was ruled out with a left knee injury in the third quarter of their 13-9 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on Thursday night. He was checked out on the field by the Texans' medical staff before walking off the field without any assistance. He had four tackles before his injury. However, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter that Johnson suffered a sprained MCL and is expected to miss four to six weeks, pending further testing.\n\nJohnathan Joseph, CB, Houston Texans: Joseph injured his shoulder while making a tackle in the first half of Thursday's win over the Bengals, and he did not return to the game. An MRI on Joseph's injured shoulder did not reveal any serious damage; however, further testing will be done.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T21:40:00.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0917%2Fr260037_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"w+tTUfs2FxDVCSsXuTGDcg==\n"}

(0:34)\n\nShortly after exiting the game due to injury, Panthers tight end Greg Olsen returned to the sideline on crutches and wearing a walking boot. The fact that Olsen's foot was immobilized and in a non-weight-bearing position was an immediate signal that his injury was of concern. After the game, Olsen told reporters he had broken his foot. Coach Ron Rivera told reporters Olsen would follow up with noted foot and ankle surgeon Dr. Robert Anderson on Monday.\n\nEditor's Picks Panthers TE Ed Dickson: Don't change playbook because Greg Olsen is out Ed Dickson said that he's confident he can step in for the injured Greg Olsen, who has been one of the NFL's most productive TEs in recent seasons.\n\nWhile further details of Olsen's injury and a timeline are yet to come, he has already noted that he suffered a fracture. Fracture healing takes approximately six weeks depending on the type and location, along with the player's ability to heal. And, even though Olsen did not specify which bone is broken, the most common foot fracture among NFL players is the Jones fracture.\n\nJones fractures are fractures of the fifth metatarsal, the long bone on the outside of the forefoot that runs between the pinkie toe and the midfoot. This outer forefoot bone is subjected to significant torsional stress in an athlete during pivoting, pushing off, sharp deceleration and twisting. It is also subject to impact stress with repeated running and jumping, making it an easy injury target for a pass-catching tight end.\n\nIf this is indeed a Jones fracture for Olsen, the challenge in trying to heal is that the bone here does not have a particularly good blood supply, which results in a frequent failure to heal independently, even with immobilization. For this reason, surgical fixation of Jones fractures (with implantation of a screw) has become the standard of care, especially in elite athletes, who will return to high-stress activities and whose specific movements in their sport put them at an otherwise increased risk of failure.\n\nRange of recovery varies for these particular injuries, but there are other NFL offensive skill position athletes who have suffered Jones fractures recently who can serve as comparables. Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant missed six games (over seven weeks) in 2015 after undergoing surgery to repair a Jones fracture. Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman was injured in Week 10 of the same season and missed the remainder of the regular season but returned in the playoffs (nine weeks later). Both of these players ended up undergoing subsequent procedures in the offseason (which can happen in a small percentage of athletes).","author":"Stephania BellESPN Senior Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T22:00:00.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0917%2Fr260135_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"ADcvErxZfumRrRYfiVM7Pg==\n"}

(0:47)\n\nNEW ORLEANS -- The New England Patriots looked like the New England Patriots again, and it all started with quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nBreathing fire all week after a season-opening loss for which he said the team’s attitude and competitiveness needed to be at a higher level, Brady turned in a masterpiece in Sunday’s 36-20 win over the New Orleans Saints at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.\n\n\"To be 0-1 with a 10-day break felt like a year,\" Brady said afterward.\n\nOne snapshot that reflected Brady's leadership came at the start of the fourth quarter, when the Patriots were in control with a 33-13 lead, as he paced up and down the sideline while speaking with emotion to each position group. He was clearly letting them know they couldn’t have a repeat of the opener, when they were outscored 21-0 in the final quarter.\n\nThe Patriots finished stronger, but it was their start that was truly dazzling.\n\nAfter Brady had called for a higher level of competitiveness, he backed it up by throwing for three first-quarter touchdowns for the first time in his 18-year career. That gave the Patriots an early cushion as they continue to work through some defensive issues.\n\n\"He just led vocally, he led by actions,\" wide receiver Brandin Cooks said. \"That's the biggest thing that you can ask from your quarterback. He did just that.\"\n\nBy game’s end, Brady had finished 30-of-39 for 447 yards and set the record for most career games (52) with three or more touchdowns and no interceptions (he had previously been tied with Peyton Manning).\n\nWhat you need to know in the NFL\n\n• Statistics\n\n• Scoreboard\n\n• 2017 schedule, results\n\n• Standings\n\nAccording to the Elias Sports Bureau, Brady also joined Warren Moon as the only quarterbacks age 40 or older in NFL history to throw for at least 400 yards and three touchdowns in a game. Moon accomplished the feat in October 1997.\n\nIt helped, of course, that the Saints’ defense is one of the NFL’s worst and continues to struggle.\n\nSo in looking ahead to next Sunday’s home game against J.J. Watt and the Houston Texans, it should be a much tougher challenge. But after a week in which emotions stirred, with Brady and the Patriots having extra time to stew on their season-opening loss, they’ll deal with that challenge in due time.\n\nMore importantly for them, led by Brady, they were back to their usual form on Sunday, as a large Patriots fan contingent could be heard loudly at the end of the game chanting the top storyline of the day: “Brady! Brady! Brady!\"\n\n\"Hopefully, they are all out on Bourbon Street; this is a good road game to come to,\" Brady said with a smile.\n\n\"I heard them. There was a lot kind of spread there on that first level. It's great to see the support. We have that at different places. It's always great coming on the road and they have all the crowd noise and momentum and then you're there at the end and they're cheering for our team.

In the other, they played a defensive battle that was tied until midway through the fourth quarter, when Justin Houston deflected an Eagles pass that teammate Chris Jones intercepted. The play set up Kansas City’s go-ahead touchdown.\n\nThe common denominator is that both games were Kansas City victories, the latest being a 27-20 decision against the Philadelphia Eagles at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nChiefs tight end Travis Kelce leaps over Eagles cornerback Rasul Douglas for a fourth-quarter touchdown.

You’ve got to find ways to make adjustments sometimes.\n\n“I thought it was big that we didn’t get frustrated.

They scratched out a measly existence for almost three quarters before finally prevailing with two touchdowns from Kareem Hunt and one from Travis Kelce in the game’s final 17 minutes.\n\nThe Chiefs trailed much of the game against New England but they always felt in control. Their offense usually had an answer for the Patriots.\n\nAgainst the Eagles, it felt like the Chiefs were always living on the edge because they’re offense couldn’t handle what Philadelphia was bringing, which was relentless pressure. The Chiefs were rendered helpless for much of the game by the Eagles’ heat. Smith was sacked four times.\n\nBut the Chiefs found a way to win, and for that they deserve some credit. The Eagles presented the Chiefs with some problems the Patriots didn't, but the Chiefs hung around long enough to finally solve them.","author":"Adam TeicherESPN Staff Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T20:18:31.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0917%2Fr260012_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"Wd3msbhOYh5fQcPrI455Mw==\n"}

You wouldn't like Tom when he's angry.\n\nOn second thought, fantasy players most certainly would like Tom Brady when he's angry -- or in this case, reeling from an embarrassing, unexpected loss in the Thursday night Week 1 opener -- as we're the ones who reap the statistical rewards. Brady lit up the New Orleans Saints' defense, leading his New England Patriots to a 36-20 victory in which he managed 30.8 fantasy points -- best-among the early Sunday games.\n\nPredictably, you can expect to see a lot of Patriots on the \"winning\" side of this week's column.\n\nAs we do each week, we recap the week's winners and losers from a fantasy perspective, complete with applicable game and historical data. Check back after the conclusion of the 1 and 4 p.m. ET (and, when applicable, Sunday Night Football) games for our picks of the week's best and worst.\n\nWinners\n\nTom Brady, QB, Patriots: This represents the 18th time in Brady's career that he has scored at least 30 fantasy points in a game. That's the second-most such performances by any player, behind only Drew Brees' 20. Remarkably, Brady's game could have looked much different depending on how things played out, as he could have had as many as two additional passing touchdowns if not for a drop by Rob Gronkowski and an underthrown pass, and he could have had two interceptions if not for those plays being called back by penalties. Brady was the most-started quarterback of Week 2, active in 97.5 percent of ESPN leagues, and with good reason. There was little cause to doubt his ability after the opener, and this should silence any doubters.\n\nKareem Hunt, RB, Kansas City Chiefs: Another week, another big game by the rookie. Comparatively speaking, a 25.9 PPR fantasy point total probably looks like a comedown from his stunning, 45.6 point opening-week effort, but it earned Hunt the top score among running backs in the Sunday 1 p.m. ET block. It also gave him 63.5 non-PPR and 71.5 PPR fantasy points through his first two career games, both of which are second-most by any player at any position since 1950, trailing only Billy Sims' 74.5 and 78.5 scored in 1980 Weeks 1-2. Hunt went from being started in 69.8 percent of ESPN leagues in the opener to 96.2 percent in Week 2, and with his speed and receiving ability, he'll be rightfully regarded a weekly RB1 going forward.\n\nMichael Crabtree, WR, Oakland Raiders: For only the third time in his 113-game NFL career, Crabtree reached the 30-point plateau in PPR fantasy scoring, and for the second time, he scored three touchdowns in a game. He was a perfect 6-for-6 catching his targets en route to leading all players through the Sunday 4 p.m. ET games. While Crabtree's fantasy managers who drafted him 36th overall (37.3 ADP) in the preseason were surely pleased, Amari Cooper's were not. After all, they drafted Cooper 23rd (23.4 ADP) and have gotten 20.8 fewer PPR fantasy points out of him (45.3 for Crabtree, 24.5 Cooper) on five more targets (18 for Cooper, 13 Crabtree), with Cooper leading the seasonal red-zone target battle, 4-2.\n\nC.J. Anderson, RB, Denver Broncos: There's the C.J. Anderson we saw during the final eight weeks of 2014! Anderson's 27.4 non-PPR fantasy points represented his second-best single-game score (28.7, 2014 Week 17), and his 30.4 PPR fantasy points were best among running backs through Sunday's 4 p.m. ET games and his third-best single-game effort. He was started in 64.9 percent of ESPN leagues in Week 2, but with his tallying 45 carries to Jamaal Charles' 19 in the season's first two weeks, Anderson is likely to see that number increase come Week 3.\n\nCarson Wentz, QB, Philadelphia Eagles: That's two weeks of productive fantasy point totals, as Wentz followed up his fifth-best-among-quarterbacks 18.9 of Week 1 with a career-high 24.8 points on Sunday. He also has back-to-back 300-yard passing efforts, a feat he only accomplished once during his rookie season in 2016 (Weeks 13-14). Wentz faces his toughest test yet in Week 3, battling the New York Giants' defense, but he has emerged as a clear weekly starter in 2QB formats, and he's developing into one of the stronger streaming choices in standard leagues -- although you'll probably want to avoid that matchup next week in those.\n\nJavorius Allen, RB, Baltimore Ravens: Danny Woodhead's fill-in had one of the most productive fantasy scores of Week 2, and don't overlook that Allen paced the Ravens' backfield with 14 carries to Terrance West's 8 and Alex Collins' 7. The result was 21.1 PPR and 16.1 non-PPR fantasy points, both of which were the third-best totals in his career. Yes, game flow probably had something to do with Allen's rushing usage, but that's now the second consecutive week that was the case, signaling the team's interest in keeping West's workload in check, and West's 2.8 yards per carry paled in comparison to Allen's 4.7. Allen might now be one of Week 3's most-added players -- rightfully so -- in the 59.3 percent of ESPN leagues in which he remains available. To those considering him, be aware that he was the No. 4 running back in terms of PPR fantasy points (117.0) and No. 9 in non-PPR (79.0) during the second half of the 2015 season (Weeks 10-17).\n\nTravis Kelce, TE, Chiefs: The top-scoring tight end during Sunday's 1 p.m. ET block, Kelce scored 24.3 PPR fantasy points, including a 15-yard receiving touchdown in the fourth quarter that put his Chiefs ahead for good. This was his fourth game with at least 20 fantasy points in his past 12 in the regular season, and it helped him extend his position lead in the category since the beginning of the 2016 campaign (256.7).\n\nRob Gronkowski, TE, Patriots: Before departing with a groin injury, Gronkowski was one of Sunday's most productive fantasy players -- and be aware that he cost himself 9.2 PPR fantasy points on a costly drop in the end zone early in the game. Nevertheless, he managed 23.6 PPR fantasy points, good for second-best at his position during the Sunday 1 p.m. ET block.\n\nTodd Gurley, RB, Los Angeles Rams: Are we so sure Gurley is a sell-high candidate? After finishing Week 1 with a noteworthy 2.1 yards-per-carry average, his Week 2 mark of 5.5 is a welcome sight to fantasy players. His 23.6 non-PPR and 26.6 PPR fantasy points ranked second-most among running backs through the 4 p.m. ET games, and were the third-best single-game efforts of his career as well as his most since 2015 Week 14 (26.7 and 27.7). That's not to say that Gurley's stock rose significantly as a result of his Week 2 effort -- he was already highly valued -- but there's still plenty of reason to believe he could challenge for a top-10 finish among running backs in 2017.\n\nChris Thompson, RB, Washington Redskins: Say hello to one of the most underrated players in PPR leagues, as Thompson is remarkably rostered in 43.9 percent of ESPN leagues despite his scoring the 28th-most points among running backs (147.5) and the 12th-most in Week 1 (15.6). He upped the bar on Sunday, setting new career highs with 25.6 PPR and 22.6 non-PPR fantasy points. If he's still out there in your league, you can be sure he won't be by next Sunday.\n\nJ.J. Nelson, WR, Arizona Cardinals: Who'd have guessed that Nelson would be the highest-scoring wide receiver during Sunday's 1 p.m. ET block? Not many people, as evidenced by his 7.5 percent start rate in ESPN leagues. That was still quite a jump from his 0.6 percent rate in Week 1, even if it made some sense after the team scratched John Brown (quadriceps). His 23.0 PPR fantasy points were the third-best numbers in his career, and his 18.0 non-PPR fantasy points were fifth-best. Nelson has the speed to be a good risk/reward play in your WR3 slot when the matchup calls, so consider him among your Week 3 pickups.\n\nChris Hogan, WR, Patriots: He was another success story from the Patriots' game, scoring 18.8 PPR fantasy points, the third-most in his career. Hogan was started in 38.5 percent of ESPN leagues, and he should continue to benefit from a healthy target total if Danny Amendola (inactive, concussion) struggles to recover quickly.\n\nDerrick Henry, RB, Tennessee Titans: The Titans-Jacksonville Jaguars game was yet another of those classic \"fantasy fails,\" a 37-9 Titans victory in which once fantasy owners checked the box score, they realized that practically none of the Titans' more prominent names contributed a big score. Henry's was the one that stood out, as he managed 15.2 PPR fantasy points, the fourth time in his past seven regular-season games that he has scored in double digits, and he out-carried DeMarco Murray (14-6) for the second time in his past three regular-season games. Kudos to those of you in the 1.5 percent of ESPN leagues who were so bold as to start Henry. (Side note: Jonnu Smith, who scored 11.0 PPR fantasy points, was started in 0 percent of leagues.)\n\nLosers\n\nJordan Howard, RB, Chicago Bears: Though he played on Sunday despite being listed as questionable with a shoulder injury, Howard never got anything going and finished with a miserable 0.7 fantasy points -- PPR or non-PPR -- on just nine carries. It was easily the worst performance of his 17-game NFL career, and it was of particular concern because his backup, Tarik Cohen, managed another 15 total touches and 12.8 PPR fantasy points. Howard was started in 83.6 percent of ESPN leagues, a rate that is likely to drop in Week 3 with his role beginning to come into question.\n\nEzekiel Elliott, RB, Dallas Cowboys: For the first time in his NFL career of 17 games, Elliott was held to single-digit fantasy points, his 6.2 PPR and 2.2 non-PPR points easily the worst numbers of his career so far. He was started in 99.4 percent of ESPN leagues, which was actually up by more than three percent from his Week 1 number (96.2) despite his facing the Broncos defense.\n\nJaguars defense: What a mess their game was, as the Jaguars D/ST, started in 53.1 percent of ESPN leagues after they tied for the leading score at the position in Week 1 (29, tied with the Los Angeles Rams), finished the 1 p.m. ET block with the second-fewest fantasy points (minus-1). That said, there remain three more favorable matchups (than this one) for this defense coming up: at New York Jets (Week 4), versus Los Angeles Rams (Week 6), at Indianapolis Colts (Week 7). So exercise some patience with this squad, and don't discard it as a streaming option.\n\nCam Newton, QB, Carolina Panthers: Although an 11.8 point fantasy score might not seem devastating on the surface, Newton's performance on Sunday represented a second consecutive in which he fell short of expectations. After all, he's still being started in a significant percentage of ESPN leagues -- 71.3 percent, to be exact. In Newton's two games since recovering from offseason shoulder surgery, he has now scored the 25th- (13.1, Week 1) and 12th-fewest fantasy points in his 95 career NFL starts, continuing to raise the question about his health. Things do get better for Newton in Week 3, as he'll battle a New Orleans Saints defense that has served up 56.3 fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks through two weeks, but he'll be heavily scrutinized if he can't reverse his performance facing that matchup.\n\nLeGarrette Blount, RB, Eagles: Though the Eagles had hinted at a possibly reduced role for him in Week 2, his fantasy managers couldn't have forecasted he wouldn't garner a single carry on Sunday. Blount, who was started in 26.3 percent of ESPN leagues, scored only 1 PPR fantasy point, that entirely the result of his one catch. It was his worst performance since 2015 Week 7 (minus-0.3 points in either format), and it's most disconcerting because it hints at a reduction of his role to only short-yardage and possible goal-line work.\n\nAdrian Peterson, RB, Saints: For the second consecutive week, Peterson was used in a limited role, following up his 1.8 PPR fantasy points of Week 1 with 2.6 on Sunday. Those now represent his third- and fourth-worst single-game performances in his 125-game NFL career. Saints coach Sean Payton is clearly using a committee approach in his backfield, and those who drafted Peterson need to re-evaluate him as more of a borderline flex play when the matchup is right.\n\nCharles Clay, TE, Buffalo Bills: After his 15.3 PPR fantasy point performance in the opener, Clay became one of the week's more popular pickups, his ownership percentage going from 10.0 percent of ESPN leagues in Week 1 to 33.7 percent on Sunday. Thankfully, he was started in only 17.7 percent, perhaps recognizing his challenging matchup, which resulted in a mere 2.3 non-PPR and 5.3 PPR fantasy points for Clay.\n\nJimmy Graham, TE, Seattle Seahawks: If you blinked, you missed his fantasy contribution to Week 2. Graham managed just one catch on his two targets for 1.1 PPR (and 0.1 non-PPR) fantasy points, his worst single-game score since 2014 Week 13 (0.0) and the ninth-worst score of his 107 career NFL games. He was started in 86.2 percent of ESPN leagues, making him one of the five most started at his position.\n\nBilal Powell, RB, New York Jets: His situation couldn't be much more frustrating, as per Pro Football Focus' Nathan Jahnke, Powell played just 17 snaps on Sunday, nine fewer than Matt Forte, explaining Powell's mere 1.3 fantasy points (in either format). Powell touched the football half as often in Week 2 (6) as he did in the opener (12), letting down the 29.4 percent of managers in ESPN leagues who started him. That's two consecutive weeks in which Forte has been used more prominently of the two, out-snapping Powell 63-47 in the process. Unfortunately, while it's probable that Powell will improve over the course of the year, mainly because he's the younger player of the two and therefore more likely to hold up, the Jets' weak offense caps much of his rushing upside. He's a flex-play candidate at best.\n\nLarry Fitzgerald, WR, Arizona Cardinals: Many fantasy players figured Fitzgerald would play a huge part for the Cardinals in the wake of David Johnson's injury, evidenced by his 91.7 percent start rate in ESPN leagues, he managed just 5.1 PPR fantasy points (and 2.1 in non-PPR). In 204 career NFL games, only 19 times did he have a lower score.\n\nMike Wallace, WR, Baltimore Ravens: For only the third time in his career, Wallace was held to one catch or fewer in consecutive games -- note that he had a five-game streak from 2015 Weeks 8-12 -- as he followed up his 1.8 point PPR effort of Week 1 with a mere 1.7 PPR fantasy points on Sunday. While Wallace -- and for the most part the Ravens' passing game -- hasn't needed to do much while leading for a large portion of each of their games, it's a troubling development nevertheless considering Jeremy Maclin has scored touchdowns in back-to-back games to begin his Ravens career while earning nine targets to Wallace's four in those contests.\n\nBrandin Cooks, WR, Patriots: One of the most started wide receivers in fantasy in Week 2, as Cooks was active in 97.6 percent of ESPN leagues, Cooks was a total dud in his return to New Orleans on Sunday. He managed just 6.3 PPR fantasy points, his seventh-worst single-game output in 44 career contests. Cooks was targeted on just four of Brady's 45 pass attempts, which seems more like an aberration than trend.\n\nKirk Cousins, QB, Redskins: Like Newton, Cousins' 11.9 fantasy point output wasn't catastrophic, but it still placed him outside the top 15 at his position in a week during which he was started in 53.4 percent of ESPN leagues. Worse yet: Cousins scored that on the heels of a 10.6 point opening week, and he has showed little in the way of chemistry with any of his wide receivers. Things should improve for him in Week 3, as he'll battle the Raiders in a home game, but he's going to need to rebound in a major way in that game in order to avoid sinking into the \"streaming\" tier.","author":"Tristan H.

(1:10)\n\nTAMPA, Fla. -- It’s time for the Chicago Bears to bench quarterback Mike Glennon and turn the offense over to rookie Mitchell Trubisky for the rest of the season and beyond.\n\nWhatever faith the city of Chicago had left in Glennon evaporated during Sunday’s disastrous first half, when Glennon turned the ball over three times -- including a pick-six -- against his former Tampa Bay Buccaneers team on the way to a 29-7 loss for the Bears.\n\nGlennon is too limited to consistently play well enough to beat quality opponents. Give Glennon credit for almost pulling the rabbit out of the hat late in last week’s loss to the Atlanta Falcons, but he came crashing back down to reality Sunday against the Bucs at Raymond James Stadium.\n\nBears quarterback Mike Glennon threw two interceptions and lost a fumble in Sunday's 29-7 loss to the Buccaneers. Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports\n\nOn the verge of watching another season slip away, Bears coach John Fox -- who sports a 9-25 record in Chicago -- must re-energize the team.\n\nEveryone is curious to see what Trubisky can do, especially after the No. 2 overall draft pick’s impressive preseason.\n\nYes, Trubisky will make mistakes as he learns on the job.\n\nSo what?\n\nTrubisky can do what Glennon cannot: extend plays outside the pocket with his feet and make deep, accurate throws down the field. Trubisky is an exciting player to watch. Glennon, unfortunately, is not. Glennon wasn't the only problem Sunday, but he plays the most important position.\n\nGlennon is a hard-working, high-character guy, but running him out there next week at Soldier Field -- in front of a win-deprived fan base -- doesn’t give the Bears the best chance to beat the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nWhat you need to know in the NFL\n\n• Statistics\n\n• Scoreboard\n\n• 2017 schedule, results\n\n• Standings\n\nTrubisky might not defeat the Steelers, either, but the Bears have to see what he’s capable of.\n\nForget the notion of protecting Trubisky’s health and psyche. Trubisky is a football player; you can’t seal him up in bubble wrap. And you don’t draft a quarterback No. 2 overall with the plan to redshirt him an entire season behind Glennon and Mark Sanchez. That strategy only works when the guy in front of him is a future Hall of Famer -- think Brett Favre or Drew Brees.\n\nThe Bears tried to ease in Trubisky as best they could, but that plan should be out the window.\n\nMake no mistake, these are desperate times. With injuries piling up -- again -- the Bears (0-2) are in danger of missing the playoffs for the seventh straight season.\n\nThe Bears can’t wait any longer. The future is now.\n\nChicago needs a spark.\n\nAnd Trubisky is the only guy with the potential to provide one.","author":"Jeff DickersonESPN Staff Writer ","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T20:05:10.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0917%2Fr259857_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"lBDKxprPI7mLTRijky3Uhw==\n"}

Co-showrunner Aaron Harberts discusses the original pitch to tell stories set in multiple Trek time periods.\n\nI visited the set of CBS’ Star Trek: Discovery recently, where I sat down with executive producer and co-showrunner Aaron Harberts. (You can read excerpts from our chat about religion, war, and continuity in Star Trek: Discovery here.) And while I had him, I had to ask about reports that Discovery co-creator Bryan Fuller had originally pitched the network on the idea of the show as a seasonal anthology along the lines of American Horror Story.\n\nAHS, for example, resets its premise and cast of characters each year. According to an August story in EW, Discovery would’ve started a “journey through the eras of Captain James T. Kirk and Captain Jean-Luc Picard, and then go beyond to a time in Trek that’s never been seen before.” Fuller eventually left the Discovery showrunner gig and Harberts and Gretchen Berg took over for him, but I wondered what remained of that original pitch for the show’s subsequent seasons.\n\nStar Trek: Discovery - 13 Things We Learned on the Set 10+ IMAGES Fullscreen Image Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC 01 OF 14 Here are 13 things we learned on the set of Star Trek: Discovery. 01 OF 14 Here are 13 things we learned on the set of Star Trek: Discovery.

Have a writer on Star Trek: Discovery do a three-episode arc on a sliver of Next Gen that maybe you haven’t seen before. Or a little runner about what happened to [Discovery’s main character] Michael Burnham in her teenage years on Vulcan. Just trying to find opportunities to fill out the universe as it were, bring in writers who might not be on staff at the show, and just start kind of plotting different storylines.”\n\nAccording to that same EW story, CBS responded to Fuller with the suggestion that he create “a single serialized show and then [see] how it performed.” And Harberts says that’s essentially where Star Trek: Discovery stands right now.\n\n“For Discovery, that’s our ship, that’s our cast, that’s our crew, and we’re sticking with telling storylines through that lens,” he told me.\n\nHarberts added that such ideas could’ve been spin-offs or possibly even a two-hour movie. “Things that could have also been done while everyone’s waiting for Discovery to come back,” he said. But he also thinks that it’s too early to tell where any of this will lead, and he’s just focused on making Discovery as good as he can right now.\n\n“I think it could happen -- I think a lot of it depends on how Discovery does,” he said. “And one thing that I’ve learned is, and truly, I’ve said this up and down the halls. People will be like, you can’t shut up about that: Star Trek is really bigger than all of us. And so there may be a plan for it at CBS that I’m not aware of. They may have a plan. They certainly had a plan about rolling this out. All I can really speak to is my involvement on Discovery, and that’s got all of our attention.”\n\nStay tuned to IGN for more from the set of Star Trek: Discovery as we lead up to the series premiere on September 24.\n\nTalk to Senior Editor Scott Collura on Twitter at @ScottCollura.","author":"Scott Collura","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-14T14:05:46.000Z"},"source":"ign","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/09/14/1280-startrekdiscovery-generations-1505348454280_1280w.jpg","digest":"rkpBGsbjldgvMDndmQOjiQ==\n"}

Early art included!","title":"Designing Hearthstone's Death Knights - IGN","url":"http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/09/14/designing-hearthstones-death-knights","text":"Share. Team 5 reveal some of the bonkers ideas that were left on the cutting room floor. Team 5 reveal some of the bonkers ideas that were left on the cutting room floor.\n\nOne of the marquee features of the most recent Hearthstone expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne, is the fact that each class gets a brand new hero card. These cards turn each hero into a Death Knight, and radically shift up the gameplay. I recently caught up with Team 5 senior designer Mike Donais and game designer Dean Ayala for a chat about the design process behind those cards. Not only that, but the guys dived into the vault to provide work in progress art for some of the early designs! You're going to love seeing some of this stuff.\n\n(Oh, and this is part two of the interview, so be sure to check out Mike and Dean's thinking behind the recent Hearthstone card nerfs here.)\n\nIGN: Before we get into specific Death Knight cards, take me through the initial design phase; when you decided to do a Death Knight for each class, and that it would be a different type of card. Laying the groundwork for what was to come for Frozen Throne.\n\nMike Donais: Something that we wanted to do for a long time was make more cards like Jaraxxus, he's one of our favourite cards in the game. He does some really cool stuff. He was implemented as a minion, which means he has all these weird interactions. Sometimes he ends up in play as a 3/15 minion. Sometimes a secret will trigger and do something to him that you didn't expect.\n\nSo, we wanted to do it in a nice clean way as a new card type. We talked for a while about when to do that new card type of heroes. We wanted to make sure that it was a set where it was really worth it; it was really about those new heroes, and that new hero card. And this, Knights of the Frozen Throne, we were introducing all nine heroes as Death Knights, it was the perfect set for that. Each of our old heroes was coming back as something badass, more awesome, than we've ever seen before.\n\nDean Ayala: Yeah, we went through some iterations… one of the problems with Jaraxxus is sometimes you don't want to play him, because you are in a meta-game where being at 15 health after you just played a big card, and haven't done anything else in your turn, is just not something you can do.\n\nOriginally we had thought, \"Hey, maybe we'll make a bunch of cards like Jaraxxus,\" but ended up going off of that thought pretty quickly. Just because we didn't want all of these awesome character cards that we planned on doing to be something that you couldn't play because you are worried about going too low. It's like doing the same sort of design as Jaraxxus, so we ended up keeping them as sort of like, you get this 5 armour, so they all have some consistency, and they all look a bit different than any card that you've seen in Hearthstone previously. And also, you get to keep your old health, which is a bit different than the Jaraxxus implementation. But, we thought that it ended up being pretty cool in play-testing.\n\nIGN: So, how early on did that idea to unify the five armour come about, but also the flexibility to have things like different meta costs? Overall it must have been a really exciting path to start to go down to design nine of these cards.\n\nMike Donais: Yeah, it was. Pretty early on we decided that we were thinking, \"Hey, would they set you up to 15 health or 20 health,\" and it's like, sometimes that will be big heal for you and sometimes it would feel bad because it would deal 10 or 15 damage to you. If there's a burst damage deck in the meta then setting yourself to 15 is just setting yourself up to die. Pretty early on, we identified that, \"Okay, let's not change your health total.\" If you're gonna take a turn off, let's give you 5 armor to make up for that, as a little bonus. And let's give them all a battle cry so they have an immediate impact of some kind. Then leave your health exactly the same.\n\n“ \"Rexxar and Jaina and Anduin are characters that we take very seriously, so we wanted to do them all justice.\" - Dean Ayala.\n\nWe were talking about whether it should say, plus 5 healing or plus 5 armour in the bottom corner there? It became obvious, fairly quickly, that plus 5 armour was more clear on what it would do. Having a 5 with a heart around it or something would be like, \"Well, does that set me to 5 health?\"\n\nDean Ayala: To answer your other question too, it was very exciting and also a bit stressful. All these characters are very important to Hearthstone obviously. Rexxar and Jaina and Anduin are characters that we take very seriously, so we wanted to do them all justice. We wanted them all to be cards that people would be very excited to play. Cards that are not only really exciting for people wanting to build a deck, but also for all of them to be a reasonable power level that you might think about playing in a Hearthstone game.\n\nIf your favourite class is Warrior, we want you to be able to think about playing the warrior hero card, or Garrosh in your deck. Getting them all balanced correctly and also be very, very exciting, was super important to us. We went through a lot of design iteration on all of them, to figure out what hero cards even were. Not only from the design side, but also from the art side. How do they come into play and what does the card look like? We didn't want it to look like a spell, and we didn't want it to look like a minion.\n\nSo a lot of work went into these things to make them feel different and awesome and exciting, because, y’know, they were a new card type. They were really the point of interest for Knights of the Frozen Throne in general. And also, they were our heroes, they’re very important to us.\n\nIGN: Was there a particular card that cemented - yes, this is the right direction to go in? Did you get Frost Lich Jaina worked out and that set the tone? Or was it all bubbling away organically and came together later on?\n\nMike Donais: Flavour wise, the Cinematics Team presented the idea of, \"Hey, everyone's a Death Knight and Frost Lich Jaina is the face.\" So that concept, flavour wise, like - yeah, of course she's a Frost Lich - that's so cool to us. That sort of cemented it in flavour wise.\n\nThen we had to start doing the mechanical design. That took us quite some time to get designs we were happy with, both for all nine battle cries and all nine hero powers. Dean printed out some of the previous ones before we came to this meeting, and just going through them, \"Wow, we had a lot of crazy ideas.\"\n\nDean Ayala: We initially were looking at all the hero card designs, and a lot of times, the first time that we design something on the sheet, it actually ends up staying all the way through. The numbers might change, but the general concept of the design sticks around. For the hero cards, there were zero that stayed from their original design through. None of them escaped being redesigned at some point, which is pretty interesting. It's not to say that the original ones weren't very good. It was just that they were so important that we tried more things with these hero cards than we do with basically any of the other cards that we've made.\n\nIGN: Should we run through some of those earlier designs? I am so fascinated by the journey to get to the final card. Is there anywhere in particular that you'd like to start?\n\nMike Donais: We'll start with Valeera. One of the things we had is, our concept artist drew out a bunch of the heroes for us - what would they look like corrupted? That really helped us hone in on, \"Wow that's so bad ass!\" With Shadowreaper Anduin, and we saw his concept, we were like, \"Holy cow! That's just creepy.\" Valeera was another one like that. We're like, \"Wow. She's like a shadow now.\" What does that mean? Stealth obviously came to mind. One of her designs was battle cry, give your hero and minions stealth until your next turn.\n\nIGN: Woah.\n\nDean Ayala: It was very close to what she ended up with. The hero power was “discover a secret from any class.”\n\nIGN: What? That would be mental.\n\nMike Donais: Yeah, it was really awesome. It was a bit weird, because you're like, \"Wait, now she has a Mage and a Hunter secret in play, how do I play around both of those?\"\n\nIGN: I guess that's happened before with Yogg.\n\nMike Donais: Yup. And that was crazy too. We liked that, because secrets and being a shadow sort of made sense concept wise, but the hero power we ended up with was even crazier.\n\nDean Ayala: It was one of the reasons that we changed some of these. They were cool designs in concept, and a lot of them were cool mechanically. It's like, \"oh, they might inspire you to do this kind of deck, or that would be cool for a card that we would make.\" But, a lot of the time we were looking at these heroes and we want to do something that was truly different. Truly something that you haven't seen before. For Valeera “discover a secret from any class” is totally wild, but I think what we ended up with was so unique that it really hit what we wanted to do.\n\nIt's the same for Hunter. The battle cry used to be, \"Summon your beasts that died this game.\" It was sort of a N’Zoth for beasts. The hero power was, deal 2 damage to all enemies. It was just a constant AOE over time to protect all the beasts that you had summoned this game.\n\nIGN: Wow.\n\nDean Ayala: Which is cool and it's crazy. It was also quite powerful and created this new deck. But, it wasn't really something that you've never seen before, so when we ended up with, “stitch these two different beasts together,” there are so many iterations that went through on that. That was something truly different that you hadn't seen before, that was very, very cool to us.\n\nIGN: Let's talk a little bit more Valeera’s hero power. I think even just wrapping your head around what that hero power means, was step one. That's a good feeling to have when you read a card – you need to see it in action and there are so much possibilities there. I feel like Valeera is the sleeper Death Knight that’s yet to be figured out and will be amazing at some point in the future.\n\nDean Ayala: Yeah. I think we all thought that Valeera was very, very powerful. It might not be the meta-game for the Valeera hero power or hero card right now, but I think at least it'll be quite powerful, at some point in some meta-game. And in basically any Rogue deck that does exist now, you can put in the Rogue hero card and it'll be quite good for you.\n\nI think Warlock is like, I think a lot of people played Warlock very early on, but over time, as more demons come out, because that card is specifically – “what demons are in Warlock right now?” That matters a lot to resummon all your demons that died this game. So I think over time, that one’s going to get better as well.\n\nIGN: Yeah, totally. I've played games against that card where they'll bring back maybe three minions. It's rarely a big enough impact to really turn the tide of the game. With that said, the Warlock DK hero power is amazing, too. We'll touch on that in a minute.\n\nLet’s come back to Deathstalker Rexxar quickly. I'm just curious about the current hero power, the build-a-beast, and how difficult it was to find the right implementation of that concept. I know that when it was first announced, Mike, you hopped into Trump’s stream or somewhere and explained, \"Here are the rules around what you're gonna be presented with to stitch together the creature.\" I can imagine that there would have been a few different ways you could've implemented that.\n\nMike Donais: Yeah. It became clear pretty quickly that picking a two six mana minions and ending with a 12 mana minion was not a good idea. [Laughs] So we restricted it to five mana or less [for each pick]. At that point you could also get minions that are outside of your class. Getting some of the warrior taunts was just a bit too weird… so we removed that. Then at one point the battle cry was, to craft a Zombeast and then summon it.\n\nThat was a bit weird, because the first Zombeast went directly into play without getting its battle cry, and all the rest went into your hand. So, the very first one you wanted to avoid picking a battle cry on. Then for all the other ones, you wanted to take battle cries on. It was kind of counter intuitive and it didn't really need to go on the battle cry. It felt like on the hero power was plenty - it communicated this awesome concept fine. So we took it off the battle cry.\n\nDean Ayala: It was on the battle cry for a while - we were play testing it. One of the really cool things about creating a custom Zombeast is, you look at your hand, you see how much mana you have to play, and then you try to pick something that either, \"Well I'm out of cards I'll just pick the biggest thing,\" or, \"I have a bunch of cards, and I'll make this really powerful guy to summon with four mana.\"\n\n[When it was] on battle cry it took a lot of that decision making out of it. You just picked the biggest thing possible, because you don't have to spend the mana for it. That was the less interesting way to craft the Zombeasts, so we ended up thinking we should change that. There wasn't really much decision making going in to summoning one on battle cry.\n\nIGN: Let's come back to Bloodreaver Gul'dan. What other things did you think about for that battle cry text? I was wondering whether, at any point you’d tied it into minions that had been discarded or anything like that?\n\n“ \"It was kind of like a Molten Giant hero card that summoned demons from your deck.\" - Dean Ayala.\n\nDean Ayala: For Gul'dan, we had the concept of Gul'dan being sort of this vampiric guy. The pictures of him were – sort of the concept of a Vampire Death Knight. So we had the hero power in, almost from the beginning. That was the hero power that we had from the very start. It was deal two, restore two, it ended up being deal three, restore three, but it's basically the same thing.\n\nThe hero itself, it was “battle cry: summon 3 demons from your deck.” But that wasn't the interesting part of it. The interesting part of it was that it originally cost 30 and it was “cost one less for each health you're missing,” so it sort of worked how old Handlock was used to playing, like, with Molten Giants, where you'd get really low and you'd be able to play these things for a tiny amount of mana. It was kind of like a Molten Giant hero card that summoned demons from your deck. It was different because of that.\n\nIGN: You just blew my mind. That sounds crazy.\n\nDean Ayala: It is super crazy. Also, it has a lot of the swingy-ness of, \"I was doing what I was supposed to do, which was kill my opponent. Then he played a zero mana gain 5 armour, summon a bunch of demons from his deck.\" Though, there's something really cool about that design, and I think that the players that have played Hearthstone for a really long time, hearkening back to playing Molten Giant is like, \"Yeah, this is really, Warlocky.\" Warlocks were doing a lot of damage to themselves, so maybe there's some synergy there. But we thought that there was enough in the, “summon the demons that die this game,” so you’re playing a demon deck and that card was interesting enough and it was fun enough to play that we didn't also need it to layer on the possible super swingy-ness of playing it for zero mana, and swinging a game totally back from being way behind.\n\nIGN: Got it. In a general sense, I also like the fact that you’re leaning back into the demon synergy for Warlock as well.\n\nDean Ayala: Yeah, I'm really excited about that kind of thing. It's pretty good now. Like I said, it will continue to grow in strength over time, as more demons get added to Warlock. Which will always be a thing. Warlocks play demons, so we'll probably continue to make demons.\n\nIGN: Let’s chat about my favourite card in the set - Shadowreaper Anduin. That in combination with Raza - it's insane the burst that Priest suddenly has. How much did that card change over time and did you anticipate exactly how people were going to use that in the Highlander decks?\n\nMike Donais: Oh yeah.\n\nDean Ayala: We played him a lot.\n\nMike Donais: We play tested him a lot in Highlander, in not Highlander, in burst desks, in OTK decks, so we had a lot of information on him. His hero power changed a lot, his battle cry changed a lot. One of his early hero powers was just resurrect - summon a random friendly minion that died this game. That was okay and it was a little bit build-around, because you’d, like, not play cheap minions, but yes to play expensive minions. It was pretty cool. One of the reasons we went away from that, was we wanted to try a more spell heavy, crazy tricky deck.\n\nThe same thing happened with Valeera. Valeera started with “discover a secret,” which is cool, but then we changed her to be a spell heavy, crazy, tricky deck. It's an identity that Rogues and Priests both have, and I think they've come up really well in the last few sets. Another one we tried was – “whenever you play a card, deal three damage to a random enemy.”\n\nIGN: Right. That's interesting.\n\nMike Donais: Yeah, it was very random.\n\n“ \"One of his early hero powers was just resurrect... [but] we wanted to try a more spell heavy, crazy tricky deck.\" - Mike Donais.\n\nDean Ayala: It was also a lot of - that one actually did result in a lot of OTKs. You don't have to play a tonne of cards when all of your cards deal three damage.\n\nIGN: True.\n\nMike Donais: And that one just happened automatically, so even if you weren't playing Reno, you could do a bunch of cheap spells and get it to trigger a bunch of times.\n\nDean Ayala: That's what sort of inspired the last version. There was something there. When it was “after you play a card, deal three damage to a random enemy,” we played it and it was a lot of face damage, but there was also something there. Like Mike was saying, you put in a little bit more cheaper spells in your deck and you have these crazy combo turns at the end of the game.\n\nThe version that we had was a bit too much. But we thought that there are these pretty cool combinations with Raza that you can do in these in the Raza Kazakus decks. And also, even if you don't have Raza, it's still pretty good. So having the crazy combinations you can do without having it be an actual OTK deck, that is killing you from 30, there was something there, so we ended up changing it and keeping the cool combo nature at the end of the game. But removing the mass face damage in one turn.\n\nIGN: I think where you landed gives players a lot of decisions and maths to do, because sometimes you have to work out what damage you're capable of, sometimes you have to use the hero power on the board to stop yourself from dying, to set up for lethal on the next turn. Sometimes you use Kazakus for one mana-cost spell just to give you a little bit of extra juice. I find it really engaging, you're not always machine gunning down your opponent. Sometimes it's just that extra burst to get you over the line. To win longer games.\n\nDean Ayala: Yeah. It helps a lot, because Priests don't have a lot of that. There's been decks in the past where you run [Prophet] Velen and Mind Blast and Malygos and do shenanigans like that. But that's not every Priest deck. You're normally, historically, pretty safe against Priests. You have five health left, you're like, \"oh, I'll be fine\". Priests, they don’t have a lot of over the top reach, this kind of gives them that extra threat at the end of the game, which is different and it also feels like you're a Shadow Priest. You're doing Shadow Priest stuff. That you're fulfilling the fantasy of what Anduin looks like when he's Shadowreaper Anduin. It hits on the core fantasy of what that is, I think as well.\n\nIGN: It's an awesome card. Was there any discussion about synergising with Shadowform, which is obviously already in the game?\n\nDean Ayala: Yeah. We talked at length about Shadowform and how it interacts with Anduin for a very, very long time now. We've had designs in the past where we did more things around Shadowform. Something we generally don't like to do in card design is reference other cards. We do it sometimes – like, we did it with Frost Lich Jaina where we referenced water elemental. But, Shadowreaper [Anduim] his power is called Voidform now, but it used to be like Empowered Shadowform, or something. So that when you cast Shadowform, there was some amount of synergy there, so maybe you could put Shadowform in your deck. But we just didn't end up needing it. Shadowform’s a cool card from the classic set and people will play it for a long time in Hearthstone. It just didn't fit in this deck. We talked about trying to make it work and trying to make all the pieces work together. It just didn't end up fleshing out the way we wanted it to. We thought that this deck could stand on its own without it.\n\nIGN: Yeah, I just hate getting it off Lyra, when I'm already in Voidform.\n\nDean Ayala: Yup. That is something we've talked about, yeah.\n\nIGN: Lets quickly dig into a couple more. Frost Lich Jaina. Such a powerful card. She doesn’t even need an elemental shell - you just need to stall the game to the point where you can play her and then your healing capacity is off the charts. And if you've got Baron Geddon in your deck, then you've got a little mini Reno right there. Tell me a little bit about designing that card specifically.\n\nMike Donais: I liked her, because she's one of the more build-around cards. People experiment with some elementals, a few, a lot, or just like two, even. Baron Geddon being the obvious one, because if you play him after Jaina, you get a bunch of life.\n\nWe started early on with the Frost Lich, so we knew it would be something frosty. We knew we wanted to make something build-around, so we tried the battle cry of “your elementals in your hand, in deck and in play all get +2/+2.” And that was close. It was a bit weird, because sometimes you would summon elementals later and they wouldn't get the +2/+2, like you've discovered them or something. So, we did an aura effect. But, that didn't capture the Death Knight. It just captured the frost part. When we came up with the idea that Lifesteal would be in the set and we figured out, \"Hey maybe we can give your elementals Lifesteal to capture the Death Knight half of her concept.\" We liked that a lot. And then we had to figure out, what else besides Lifesteal? Just giving all your elementals Lifesteal was not nearly enough, so we gave you a Water Elemental, and that helped you see, \"Oh, look, my Water Elemental has a Lifesteal icon on it.\" And your opponent would see, \"Oh, his Water Elemental has a Lifesteal icon on it.\" So you both know right away, this thing is happening.\n\nMike Donais: We actually had it summon two Water Elementals for a while. We found out it didn't need to be two, Jaina was all about the Water Elemental… you know, in Warcraft 3 she had a pet Water Elemental flying around with her. Heroes of the Storm also. So it made sense to have a Water Elemental type concept and the hero power.\n\nOne of the early versions of the hero power was deal one damage to a minion, if you kill it the hero power grows stronger. So it would do two damage the next time and then three damage and then four damage.\n\nIGN: Interesting.\n\nMike Donais: Yeah, it scaled up and by the end of the game, obviously it'd be very good.\n\n“ \"One of the early versions of the [Mage] hero power was deal one damage to a minion, if you kill it the hero power grows stronger.\" - Mike Donais.\n\nIGN: Was that too good? Or did you prefer the final implementation more?\n\nMike Donais: It was good, I mean we could cost it. We could probably balance it if we wanted to. But, once we realised it was going be about elementals, having it be a source of more elementals was really elegant. So now we changed it to “deal one damage to a minion. If you kill it, summon a Water Elemental.” It just worked out perfectly for the first half of the card, the battle cry.\n\nDean Ayala: This is one of those things that there's a bunch of goals we have when we're making cards. One of the goals is, when you read it does this sound really awesome? Does this sound like, \"Holy shit! This is crazy, I want to do this!\" And I think that “deal damage to a minion, if it dies you'll get stronger,” that actually accomplishes that goal.\n\nSome of the other goals we have are, \"Does this really create anything new that people aren't doing today?\" Maybe it does, maybe you only play this in super control decks. Maybe that's a little bit different, but for Mage particularly at the time, it wasn't a lot different.\n\nAnd then one of the other goals we have which is also super important is - in a world where people are playing this card, is it fun? Do these result in fun games? And the games where this hero power got… very good? Your opponent, anything that they played would die. Every single card. Just imagine, you know that every single time you play a minion for the rest of your game, your opponent has a free two mana Assassinate, basically.\n\nSo while it was cool, and it was cool to read, it didn't actually result in a lot of fun games. Whereas we think that the card that we did end up with, did result in some of the push and pull fun games.\n\nIGN: Makes sense. Before we finish up, let’s touch on Thrall, Deathseer and the idea of Evolve being a real class identity thing for Shaman now. How did that design come about?\n\nMike Donais: It seemed like a cool, the idea of transforming minions into ones [with a higher mana cost]. A long time ago we did a minion that transformed as a battle cry another minion. That was fun and people enjoyed it a lot, I enjoyed it. We enjoyed it so much that we're like, \"Oh, we could do more cards with this design.” And that's something we do a lot in Hearthstone, we'll do one design and people like it, so we'll do more. And now it's kind of a Shaman mechanic. We talked a lot about, \"Oh, what class should get this?\" After some discussion we figured it feels right for Shaman. Then we started doing more and more in Shaman. Evolve, Devolve, Thrall and it's like, \"Okay, yeah, we've explored this mechanic now.”\n\nPeople seem to like it. It's a little bit random, but not super random. Once in a while it's very random. It's pretty fun. We'll probably - like all mechanics - take some time off it and maybe come back to it later, if people enjoy it. I think it's a reasonable mechanic for the four or five cards that we've used on it.\n\nIGN: Yeah cool. Thanks as always for your time, guys!\n\nA huge additional thanks to Mike, Dean and the rest of the team for supplying the work in progress card art and concept art!\n\nCam Shea is senior editor in IGN's Sydney office and a CCG nerd.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bf222c1a5b11e780413910"},"description":"As the wait begins for IT: Chapter Two, here's everything we know about the horror sequel.","title":"IT: Chapter Two - Everything We Know About the Stephen King Sequel - IGN","url":"http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/09/12/it-chapter-two-everything-we-know-about-the-stephen-king-sequel","text":"Share. A sequel was always in the cards. A sequel was always in the cards.\n\nStephen King's IT just hit theaters, and already the Andres (Andy) Muschietti film is on track to become one of the most critically and commercially successful Stephen King adaptations ever. A sequel is basically guaranteed at this point. And fortunately, a sequel was always part of the plan.\n\nAs New Line charges forward with IT: Chapter Two, we've put together a handy guide breaking down everything we know about the sequel so far, including which cast and crew are definitely back, how the story ties into the original, and more. Read on for the full story on the IT sequel, but beware of vague spoilers for both films...\n\nIt's Almost Certainly Happening\n\nEven early on, IT was envisioned as the first half a duology. Producer Roy Lee acknowledged this as early as February 2016, where he told Collider, \"Gary [Dauberman] wrote the most recent draft working with Andy [Muschietti], so it’s being envisioned as two movies.”\n\nAccording to producer Beverly Muschietti (Andy's sister), New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. have yet to officially greenlight the sequel or give it a release date. However, the fact that the first just had the largest opening ever for a horror film pretty much guarantees that IT 2 will be put on the fast track. And while Lee also complained in that interview about needing to fine-tune the script for Chapter One to meet New Line's budgetary restrictions, it's probably safe to assume that IT 2 will have a larger budget to work with.\n\nWe May Know the Title\n\nWhile simply referred to as \"Stephen King's IT\" in all the marketing, the first film's end credits reveal the full, official title - IT: Chapter One. It stands to reason that the sequel will be called IT: Chapter Two.\n\nIt (1990) It (2017) 01 of 12 Pennywise the Clown has gotten a big makeover for the new movie, with a more overtly scary, court jester look.\n\nCheck out our comparison between the miniseries version of It and the new movie version above.\n\nThe sequel will build on the ending of the first and the promise Bill, Bev and the rest of the Losers Club made - that they'll all return to Derry if Pennywise ever rears his head again. It makes sense to call the sequel \"Chapter Two\" since their battle is only half over.\n\nFor more on what to expect from the sequel, here's a detailed look at how the ending sets up the events of IT: Chapter 2.\n\nThe Cast Will Be Mostly New\n\nAgain, New Line and WB have yet to formally announce IT: Chapter Two, so we don't yet know how many cast and crew will be making the jump to the sequel. We do know that writer Gary Hauberman is hard at work on penning IT: Chapter Two. Last July, Andres Muschietti told Variety, \"We’ll probably have a script for the second part in January [2018]. Ideally, we would start prep in March.\"\n\nAndy and Barbara Muschietti appear to be more or less locked in at this point. The two also recently revealed (via Entertainment Weekly) that Bill Skarsgard is officially locked down to reprise the role of Pennywise.\n\nHowever, because the sequel takes place nearly 30 years after the events of the first, it's inevitable that many of the main characters will have to be recast. Again, the success of the first may give the Muschiettis more options this time around in terms of casting recognizable actors. The two recently voiced an interest in casting Jessica Chastain as the adult Bev Marsh (Chastain starred in Muschietti's Mama). Andres told Variety, \"She loves the movie and it feels like the planets are aligned in that sense, but we still have to make that happen. There are a lot of ideas for the rest of the cast that I’m playing with, but it’s a bit too premature to say those names right now.\"\n\nThere May Be Flashbacks\n\nDespite the fact that the sequel will take place in the present and feature adult versions of the Losers Club members, we may not have seen the last of the first film's child cast. Several hints have been dropped that IT: Chapter Two will feature flashbacks to 1989. Andres Muschietti revealed to Variety, \"Part one is only about the kids. Part two is about these characters 30 years later as adults, with flashbacks to 1989 when they were kids.\"\n\nMore recently, Muschietti reiterated this plan in a chat with Entertainment Weekly. “On the second movie, that dialogue between timelines will be more present,” he said. “If we’re telling the story of adults, we are going to have flashbacks that take us back to the ‘80s and inform the story in the present day.”\n\nMuschietti revealed to Collider that a pair of scenes had to be cut from IT: Chapter One due to budgetary restrictions but could still see the light of day in the sequel.\n\n\"There are two sequences that I thought of that I had to postpone until more money comes,\" he said. \"One is a flashback, that sort of portrays the first encounter of It and humans, which is an amazing scene. And the other is a dream, where Bill sees - he’s leaning on a bridge, in Derry, and he’s spitting on the Kenduskeag Stream, and suddenly he sees the reflection of a balloon. And he looks up and it’s not one balloon, but a bunch of balloons, and then he starts to see body parts, and the shot goes wider and it’s a multitude of dead kids floating. I couldn’t afford it.\"\n\nBasically, it appears that the sequel will use flashbacks as a way of delving deeper into the nature of Pennywise and his immortal existence, as well as strengthening ties between the past and present-day storylines.\n\nThe Sequel Will Be Weirder\n\nThe It novel goes to some pretty strange places as the Losers Club members learn more about the true nature of Pennywise and encounter Maturin, the giant turtle god that vomited forth the universe. Obviously, most of that background material was left out of the first movie (apart from a small nod here or there to Maturin, like with Georgie's LEGO turtle). But it sounds like the sequel will be tackling the weirder elements of the story head-on.\n\n“I really wanted to focus on the emotional journey of the group of kids,” Muschietti told Yahoo Movies. “Getting in to that other dimension - the other side - was something that we could introduce in the second part. In the book the perspective of the writing… is always with the Losers, so everything they know about Pennywise is very speculative and shrouded in absurdity, so I wanted to respect that mystery feeling of not knowing what’s on the other side.\"\n\n“I also wanted to leave something for the second half, so I didn’t want to get in trouble with that - going into the macroverse or that transdimensional stuff - and keep it grounded, from the point of view of the kids,” Muschietti continued. “There’s another movie to expand into that. Also, there’s a physical truth that it’s a movie that has a budget. And I didn’t want to get into a depiction of a realm that f***s up our budget, the creation of a world that will basically suck up half of our budget, and would have to sacrifice a lot of things.”\n\nMuschietti told Entertainment Weekly that the character Mike Hanlon will be critical to this process in the sequel. As the one Losers Club member who stays behind in Derry, Hanlon will face a deep physical and psychological toll as he attempts to understand the evil still lurking beneath Derry. “He’s not just the collector of knowledge of what Pennywise has been doing in Derry. He will bear the role of trying to figure out how to defeat him. The only way he can do that is to take drugs and alter his mind.”\n\nThere Could Be a Director's Cut\n\nIT is one of Stephen King's longest novels (which is really saying something), and not an easy story to adapt into film form. In the novel, the narrative frequently shifts back and forth between past and present as the members of the Losers Club confront Pennywise as children and adults. Rather than try to cram all that material into one film, Dauberman and Muschietti made the sensible decision to break those twin storylines into separate films.\n\nBut there's a chance that hardcore Stephen King fans may be able to experience this story as originally intended. Producer Roy Lee told Collider, \"We’re taking it and making the movie from the point of view of the kids, and then making another movie from the point of view of the adults, that could potentially then be cut together like the novel. But it’s gonna be a really fun way of making this movie.”\n\nIn other words, don't be surprised if New Line eventually releases a four-hour-long director's cut on Blu-ray that combines the two films chronologically, a la The Godfather Saga.\n\nJesse is a mild-mannered writer for IGN.

IT now holds record for biggest September release ever.\n\nStephen King's IT had a strong second weekend in domestic theaters, retaining its first place position at the box office with an estimated $60 million.\n\nAfter a record-breaking debut last weekend, New Line's horror film has now passed the 1986 classic Crocodile Dundee to become the highest-grossing film ever to be released in the month of September (not accounting for inflation). The current domestic total for Stephen King's IT now stands at approximately $218.7 million.\n\nMeanwhile, American Assassin placed second, earning an estimated $14.8 million in its domestic debut. The Michael Cuesta-directed action thriller had an opening weekend similar to that of John Wick, which pulled in about $14.4 million when it debuted in 2014, but is behind Atomic Blonde, which earned over $18 million in its opening weekend earlier this year.\n\nThis weekend also brought with the the release of director Darren Aronofsky's mother!, which underwhelmed in its debut. The Jennifer Lawrence-led drama, which received an \"F\" CinemaScore from theatergoers, placed third with an estimated $7.5 million.\n\nHere are estimates for the top 10 releases at the North American box office this weekend, according to Box Office Mojo:\n\n1. Stephen King's IT $60 million\n\n2. American Assassin $14.8 million\n\n3. mother! $7.5 million\n\n4. Home Again $5.3 million\n\n5. The Hitman's Bodyguard $3.6 million\n\n6.

Such a name would become more useful with each passing year. There are a shocking number of examples, but I give you, as a perfect, vivid, front-of-mind example, the credit rating system of the United States of America, as exemplified by that radioactive disaster of a company called Equifax.\n\nIt is well understood by every adult American that you must keep your nine-digit Social Security Number absolutely secret, lest someone use it to open accounts in your name and ransack your name, your credit, and your sacred honor. There is a real learned helplessness to this: Americans just take it for granted that this is the way things work, it is the way things have always worked, it is the way things always will work. If your SSN and a few personal details get hacked, as with Equifax, apparently because it negligently leaving its server software unpatched for two months — that’s it, you’re screwed.\n\nThis is, of course, completely insane.\n\nHow about one where they must keep it absolutely secret but also give it out regularly over unsecured lines to access government functions? — theophile (@theophile) September 8, 2017\n\n“But what else could we do?” you might ask. “It’s not realistic for credit rating companies, the grimdark apotheosis of surveillance capitalism, to actually verify someone’s identity before someone opens a new account in their name. Not if that someone has their social security number! What else could possibly be done?”\n\nWhat if I told you that the credit rating companies already had a system to verify identities before opening new accounts — but, because this would be a minor inconvenience, and a drag on their profits, they only allow this status to last for 90 days for any given account unless a police report can be filed, and furthermore, while they may claim that they’ll do this, it’s not actually a legal requirement? From a Krebs on Security piece from 2015 (as ever, Krebs is two years ahead of the zeitgeist):\n\nWith a fraud alert on your credit file, lenders or service providers should not grant credit in your name without first contacting you to obtain your approval — by phone or whatever other method you specify when you apply for the fraud alert … Fraud alerts only last for 90 days, although you can renew them as often as you like. More importantly, while lenders and service providers are supposed to seek and obtain your approval before granting credit in your name if you have a fraud alert on your file, they’re not legally required to do this.\n\nThat’s right: a solution to the ongoing insane catastrophe which is the American credit system already exists. The infrastructure and process for it is already in place. But thanks to regulatory capture, an inability to understand the scale of data hacks that modern technology enables, or sheer incompetence, it only exists on a case-by-case, opt-in, short-term solution.\n\nObviously everybody should have this verification — “two-factor authentication,” if you will — turned on and kept on. This would not be a panacea, of course. Security hipsters will loudly protest that phones and email are terrible second authentication factors that no one should even consider using. Phone and email are not ideal, but the point is, universalizing this existing solution would hugely improve matters for a relatively trivial cost.\n\nIf you want long-term ideal 2FA, decentralized blockchain solutions, etc., more power to you! Build it and try to get it adopted! But this is something we could do today to immediately mitigate, if not outright eliminate, a huge swathe of an ongoing disaster, while waiting for an even better long-term solution.\n\nThe current credit-rating system is insane. But it gets even worse: the current system actually already contains its own solution. It is staring us in the face. All we have to do is flick the switch to turn it on. Alas, I have little to no hope that we will actually do this, because our larger socioeconomic system, which contains the credit system, does not seem particularly rational these days either. What’s the name of that fallacy again? Because are we ever going to need it in the years to come.","author":"Jon Evans","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T13:00:21.000Z"},"source":"techcrunch","urlToImage":"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/facepalm.jpg","digest":"w/67cu8ALSTzuddQoQ8nuA==\n"}

Kennedy challenged NASA and American industry to successfully conduct a Moon Landing in the 60’s; Reagan transferred the role of commercial space transportation from NASA to the private sector in the 80’s.\n\nToday, President Trump, by saving the ISS from de-orbiting in 2024, sets the stage for humankind’s movement out of earth orbit, to our nearest neighbor –- the Moon. This single act of vision and international leadership would provide a significant stimulus to a new generation of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs, with measurable, direct, and indirect economic benefits to the US economy.\n\nAmerica — and the world — is engaged in a conversation about the future possibilities of living “Off-Planet” – whether it be the Moon, Mars or beyond. And a “New Space Generation” of visionaries and commercial risk takers are considering the practical, social and economic challenges to work, produce, and live off-planet. This generation is young, multi-national, creative, opportunistic, technically skilled, and realistic about the challenges and risks that lay ahead in pursuing opportunities “out there”, beyond Earth’s orbit.\n\nThe tools for their success for off-planet ventures, development, and settlement are already close at hand — reusable rockets for transportation \u0026 supply; lasers for deep space communications; new forms of habitation as staging for longer term settlement; advanced robotics for tasks deemed unsafe or too costly for humans to perform.\n\nPrivate capital, sensing new market opportunities, appears eager to pursue space-based business models to support human expansion, such as deep space transportation, Off-Planet habitation, manufacturing, and production of food and minerals on the Moon, and possibly asteroids. What these risk takers need is a stable platform from which to stage their initial efforts. The ISS could be that platform, but no longer in Earth orbit.\n\nInstead, the ISS could be re-purposed and re-deployed from its current low earth orbit, to an orbit around the Moon. This one step would provide a significant critical, stable infrastructure for human expansion onto the lunar surface.\n\nDivesting the ownership of the ISS in favor of the private sector just makes good economic and public policy sense. Why throw the ISS away, when it could be offered to the international private sector for use as a lunar-staging infrastructure?\n\nNew space pioneers will need a safe harbor which would provide the stability of safety and security, particularly in times of trouble. The ISS could be such a safe harbor, orbiting around the Moon, and readily accessible from the lunar surface – providing security, stability, and a transition point between the Earth and the Moon for bi-directional commerce, communications, and safety.\n\nWe know the ISS requires periodic “nudging” by visiting re-supply ships, such as SpaceX, Soyuz, and Antares – previously the Space Shuttle – to re-position it into its preferred low Earth orbit. As these supply ships often conduct this maneuver whilst docked with the ISS, the nudge does not appear to be a significantly risky maneuver.\n\nSo what does it take to turn a “nudge” into a trans-space journey to a lunar orbit? And, what does it take for the US Government, in cooperation with our international space partners, to transfer the ownership of the ISS to private sector ownership? We will only get these answers if the President challenges all of us to find them in the context of the highest and best use of the ISS.\n\nAn undeniable fact of the benefits derived from this New Space business sector and its emerging venture firms is that literally everything necessary for humankind to transit space and survive Off-Plane must be developed here – on Earth. And it will be the economy of Earth and its populations that will benefit in the nearest term from the success and failure of humankind’s migration Off-Planet. For example:\n\nTransportation The funding to move the ISS will stimulate a new form of space transportation – the space barge. It has taken over 50 years for industry to develop a reliable, reusable commercial space transportation system – and it only goes to/from low earth orbit, a mere 240 miles above the Earth’s surface.The challenge and the reward for international space transportation firms is to initially design and operate a version of a space tug, which can nudge the ISS out of Earth orbit, across over 200,000 miles of deep space, and position it into a lunar orbit. But once accomplished, the space tugs will become “space freighters”, the galactic version of a trans-space trucking system connecting the Earth and the Moon, making the movement of goods and people between them a regular, reliable service.\n\nHabitation In the near term, humankind needs to bring its life-sustaining environment with it into space. Safe and reliable habitations must be deployed and tested – to sustain life in space and on the Moon. Advances in composite materials, atmospheric cleansing, waste management, and quality of life engineering must be developed on Earth and tested in deep space to ensure the safety and comfort of those seeking to live and work off-planet. And as these efforts advance humankinds sustainability off-planet, the developing companies on earth will find applications to improve the quality of life for humankind here on Earth.\n\nIn the near term, humankind needs to bring its life-sustaining environment with it into space.

And as these efforts advance humankinds sustainability off-planet, the developing companies on earth will find applications to improve the quality of life for humankind here on Earth. Communications Command and control of deep space systems must be developed to deal with transmission latencies, and throughput demand. Lags in transmissions results in a delay in commands, particularly vital to automated, robotic systems. And, humankind needs to remain connected to its culture, family, and enterprise partners on Earth whilst living Off-Planet. Humankind’s bandwidth demands will geometrically increase, as human activity arithmetically increases Off-Planet. Thus, new forms of communication technologies, such as lasers, need to be developed, and as a result leading edge international communication companies will also apply them to their Earth-bound networks and customers.\n\nCommand and control of deep space systems must be developed to deal with transmission latencies, and throughput demand.

Production.\n\nFood. It is most reasonable to think that the first inhabitants of any Off-Planet colony will be robots, not humankind. In order to survive, humankind must become self-sustaining in its food production, and not dependent on the arrival of the “next supply ship”. There is a fine balance between working to grow food, and consuming the food you grow. Get the balance wrong, and you die. But robots could “learn” to grow humankind’s food before it establishes a permanent colony Off-Planet. Old methods of food production may give way to new techniques more successful in the unique lunar soil. New stimulants, soil conditioners, and genetically altered could be tested off-planet, with applications back here on Earth in areas with challenging environmental conditions.\n\nMinerals. The goal of humankind is not to just live “off-planet” but to succeed – socially, institutionally, and financially. Previous analysis of the Moon’s mineral potential has been limited to the surface. What the Moon holds below the surface requires significant exploration. This is another area where robots can lead the way for humankind, and as such robotic systems are developed for off-planet labor, their diverse applications to tasks here on Earth grow.\n\nAll of these items, and many more, would accelerate the new space industrial base on this planet – technical, capital, economic, and social – and create an expanding, dynamic new space infrastructure “off-planet”.\n\nGovernment’s role in new space development, albeit limited, will continue by providing stability and certainty in the areas in which it is best suited, such as legal regimes ensuring private property ownership rights – where human’s settle, what they produce and develop, where they can sell or trade their products. Earth’s legal regimes are nationally-driven, but Off-Planet legal regimes should be more ubiquitous, without regard to national jurisdictions. It is within the purview of governments and their international institutions to develop and codify these rules. So as humankind moves Off-Planet, there are new opportunities for lawyers, accountants, and public policy experts.\n\nPresidential action is needed immediately, however, to ensure the ISS can be re-purposed for this mission. NASA is considering a “de-orbit” plan for the ISS, meaning “destruction”, possibly as early as 2024, resulting in a loss to US taxpayer’ investment of over $34 Billion. Destroying the ISS makes no sense.\n\nNASA and its international partners are rumored to be developing a replacement (albeit not yet OMB approved) government financed, and managed international lunar space station – maybe excluding the Russians. If true, this creates a unique opportunity. Since the ISS is not really owned by any one country, but managed under an international partner’s agreement, the ISS’ transfer to an acceptable private sector entity could be a nice trade for NASA’ invitation to its international partners to join in the new lunar station. That would relieve NASA of its $1B in annual budgetary support for the ISS, and coincidentally, option the ISS for private use.\n\nAmerica’s westward expansion in the 19th Century was stimulated by government, but led by companies and peoples seeking their futures and fortunes “out there” – beyond the established order, or physical boundaries.\n\nThe Great Expansion of Humankind in the 21st Century, off this planet is today the topic at every space conference and policy discussion, amongst billionaires and high school students. Like Kennedy and Reagan, President Trump can provide a huge stimulus to an eager private sector with this simple, audacious, cost-effective act.\n\nIn his 1stterm, President Trump can give the private sector a platform from which to commence humankind’s expansion beyond this planet by an initial first step – save the ISS.","author":"Bob Brumley","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T10:30:57.000Z"},"source":"techcrunch","urlToImage":"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/12867973205_8d4f89c87b_k.jpg","digest":"PYP5FjSL+T6ULvmU0Av+LQ==\n"}

The branding is awkward: “Belt” refers to the land-bound trading route through Central Asia and Europe, while “Road,” confusingly, stands for the maritime route stretching from Southeast Asia across the Indian Ocean to the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Still, the intentions are clear: With a lending and acquisitions blitz extending to 68 countries (and counting), OBOR seeks to create the ports, roads and rail and telecommunications links for a modern-day Silk Road — with all paths leading to China.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis is China’s long game. It’s not about immediate profits; infrastructure projects are a bad way to make money. So why is President Xi Jinping fast-tracking OBOR projects amid an economic slowdown at home and a crackdown on other overseas acquisitions? Economics is a big part: China wants to secure access to key resources, export its idle industrial capacity, even tilt the world order in its favor. But there is also a far greater cultural ambition. For centuries, Western liberalism has ruled the world. The Chinese believe their time has come. “China sees itself as a great civilization that needs to regain its status as leader of the world,” says Kadira Pethiyagoda, a fellow at the Brookings Institution Doha Center. “And America’s retreat gives China the space to do that.”\n\nIt’s tempting to see OBOR as a muscled-up Marshall Plan, the American-led program that helped rebuild Western Europe after World War II. OBOR, too, is designed to build vital infrastructure, spread prosperity and drive global development. Yet little of what China offers is aid or even low-interest lending. Much OBOR financing comes in the form of market-rate loans that weaker countries are eager to receive — but may struggle to repay. Even when the projects are well suited for the local economy, the result can look a bit like a shell game: Things are built, money goes to Chinese companies and the country is saddled with more debt. What happens when, as is often the case, infrastructure projects are driven more by geopolitical ambition or the need to give China’s state-owned companies something to do? Well, Sri Lanka has an empty airport for sale.\n\nSri Lanka may be a harbinger for debt crises to come. Many other OBOR countries have taken on huge Chinese loans that could prove difficult to repay. For example, Chinese banks, according to The Financial Times, recently lent Pakistan $1.2 billion to stave off a currency crisis — even as they pledged $57 billion more to develop the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. “The projects China proposes are so big and appealing and revolutionary that many small countries can’t resist,” says Brahma Chellaney, a professor of strategic studies at New Delhi’s Center for Policy Research. “They take on loans like it’s a drug addiction and then get trapped in debt servitude. It’s clearly part of China’s geostrategic vision.”\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

China insists it is nothing like a colonial power. Its appeal to developing countries, after all, is often based on a shared negative experience of colonialism — and the desire to have cooperative “win-win” trade and investment relationships. Unlike Western countries and institutions that try to influence how developing countries govern themselves, China says it espouses the principle of noninterference. If local partners benefit from a new road or port, the Chinese suggest, shouldn’t they be able to “win,” too — by securing its main trade routes, building loyal partnerships and enhancing its global prestige?\n\nThe last time China was a global power, back in the early 1400s, it also sought to amplify its glory and might along the Maritime Silk Road, through the epic voyages of Zheng He. A towering Ming dynasty eunuch — in some accounts he stands seven feet tall — Zheng He commanded seven expeditions from Asia to the Middle East and Africa. When he came ashore on Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka) around 1406, his fleet commanded shock and awe: It was a floating city of more than 300 ships and some 30,000 sailors. Besides seeking tributes and trade — the ships were laden with silk, gold and porcelain — his mission was to enhance China’s status as the greatest civilization on earth.\n\nAfter Zheng He’s death at sea in 1433, China turned inward for the next six centuries. Now, as the country has become a global power once again, Communist Party leaders have revived the legend of Zheng He to show China’s peaceful intentions and its historical connections to the region. His goal, they say, was not to conquer — unlike Western empires — but to establish friendly trade and diplomatic relations. In Sri Lanka today, Chinese tour groups often traipse through a Colombo museum to see the trilingual stone tablet the admiral brought here — proof, it seems, that China respected all peoples and religions. No mention is made of a less savory aspect of Zheng He’s dealings in Ceylon. On a later expedition, around 1411, his troops became embroiled in a war. Zheng He prevailed and took the local king back to China as a prisoner.\n\nThe unsanitized version of Zheng He’s story may contain a lesson for present-day China about unintended consequences. Pushing countries deeper into debt, even inadvertently, may give China leverage in the short run, but it risks losing the good will essential to OBOR’s long-term success. For all the big projects China is engaged in around the world — high-speed rail in Laos, a military base in Djibouti, highways in Kenya — arguably its most perilous step so far may be taking control of the foundering Hambantota port. “It’s folly to take equity stakes,” says Joshua Eisenman, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “China will have to become further entwined in local politics. And what happens if the country decides to deny a permit or throw them out. Do they retreat? Do they protect?” China promotes itself as a new, gentler kind of power, but it’s worth remembering that dredging deepwater ports and laying down railroad ties to secure new trade routes — and then having to defend them from angry locals — was precisely how Britain started down the slippery slope to empire.","author":"Brook Larmer","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T03:32:44.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/17/magazine/17onmoney1/17onmoney1-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"Ri1w+rlYswiOz63kVlcKxQ==\n"}

(Reuters)\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson says if diplomatic efforts with North Korea fail, a military option will be the only one left. (Reuters)\n\nThe Trump administration escalated its rhetoric against North Korea on Sunday, warning that time is running out for a peaceful solution between Kim Jong Un’s regime and the United States and its allies.\n\nAdministration officials said the risk from North Korea’s nuclear weapons program is rising, and they underscored that President Trump will confront the looming crisis at the U.N. General Assembly this week. Trump, who spoke by phone with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Saturday, referred to Kim on Twitter as “Rocket Man” and asserted that “long gas lines” are forming in the North because of recent U.N. sanctions on oil imports.\n\n[In a tweet, Trump sticks North Korea’s Kim Jong Un with a nickname: ‘Rocket Man’]\n\nThough Trump’s top aides emphasized that the administration is examining all diplomatic measures to rein in Pyongyang, they made clear that military options remain on the table.\n\n“If North Korea keeps on with this reckless behavior, if the United States has to defend itself or defend its allies in any way, North Korea will be destroyed,” Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “None of us want that. None of us want war. But we also have to look at the fact that you are dealing with someone [in Kim] who is being reckless, irresponsible and is continuing to give threats not only to the United States, but to all of its allies. So something is going to have to be done.”\n\nThis undated picture released from North Korea's Korean Central News Agency on Sept. 16, 2017, shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspecting a launching drill of the medium-and-long-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12 at an undisclosed location. (STR/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe question remains, however, how realistic the Trump administration’s threats are as the North quickly advances its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. Trump’s latest tweets came two weeks after North Korea tested a nuclear device that experts said measured at 250 kilotons, 17 times the force of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in World War II.\n\n[North Korea tested another nuke. How big was it?]\n\nTrump warned Kim last month that the North would feel the “fire and fury” of the United States if the regime continued its threats and destabilized the Korean Peninsula and East Asia. But Kim promptly responded with new threats and a round of new weapons tests.\n\nTrump is scheduled to join Moon and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at a working lunch Thursday in New York, on the sidelines of the U.N. meetings, to discuss North Korea, White House aides said. Yet Trump will not have the opportunity to meet with Xi Jinping of China and Vladi­mir Putin of Russia; both leaders are skipping the annual gathering.\n\nLast week, Haley touted the U.N. sanctions on the North, saying that, if enacted, they would cut off 30 percent of oil imports and curtail 90 percent of Kim’s exports, putting a major economic pinch on a government that has long struggled to provide for the nation’s estimated 25 million people.\n\nYet Trump said last week that he and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are skeptical that the sanctions will have a significant impact on North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. Administration officials reaffirmed the United States’ long-standing policy that the North must agree to relinquish its nuclear arsenal as a prerequisite for direct diplomatic talks.\n\n“He’s going to have to give up his nuclear weapons, because the president has said that he is not going to tolerate this regime threatening the United States and our citizens with a nuclear weapon,” national security adviser H.R. McMaster said on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\nSouth Korea's President Moon Jae-in and President Trump agreed to exert stronger pressure through sanctions on North Korea Sept. 17. (Reuters)\n\nTrump, McMaster added, has “been very clear about that, that all options are on the table.”\n\nAt the same time, the administration signaled that it is not pursuing regime change, a position that could help persuade Beijing to play a stronger role in pressuring Kim. China facilitates about 90 percent of North Korea’s trade and provides its oil.\n\nYet Tillerson said North Korea does not appear to be interested in denuclearization talks.\n\n“I’m waiting for the regime in North Korea to give us some indication that they’re prepared to have constructive, productive talks,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”\n\n“We have tried a couple of times to signal to them that we’re ready when they’re ready,” Tillerson added, “and they responded with more missile launches and a nuclear test. All they need to do to let us know they’re ready to talk is to just stop these tests, stop these provocative actions, and let’s lower the threat level and the rhetoric.”\n\nMany U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere are strongly opposed to any use of force that could further destabilize the Korean Peninsula and East Asia. The two unanimous U.N. Security Council votes for sanctions in recent weeks have marked a new level of alarm from those allies, as well as Moscow and Beijing.\n\n[For Trump and his team, a ‘time to be serious’ at United Nations debut]\n\nBut McMaster said Washington isn’t assuming the sanctions will work or buy time.\n\n“We all have our doubts about whether or not that’s going to be enough,” he said, “and so we have to prepare all options. We have to make sure all options are under development to ensure that this regime cannot threaten the world with a nuclear weapon.”\n\nAnalysts have said the North has shown rapid improvements in its ballistic missile and nuclear technologies. Recent missile tests have demonstrated the range to potentially strike the continental United States, along with the technical capacity to mount a miniature nuclear device on a missile, analysts said.\n\nThat has accelerated the urgency in Washington, at the White House and on Capitol Hill. Asked on CNN whether the Trump administration should continue to deny the North diplomatic talks until it ends its nuclear program, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said no.\n\n“I think that North Korea is not going to give up its program with nothing on the table,” she said. “I think that what could happen is that we could have reliable verification of a freeze of both the nuclear program and the missile arsenal, and that we could conceivably talk China into supporting that kind of a freeze, because it would carry with it no regime change and no war.”\n\nCarol Morello in Washington contributed to this report.","author":"David Nakamura, Anne Gearan, David Nakamura, Anne Gearan","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T12:06:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/09/17/National-Politics/Images/AFP_SH1T0.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"QRhcSHN/bWFfm90KxPyzug==\n"}

The Post's David A. Fahrenthold looked at the trend of charities leaving Trump properties. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nFor two years, a shelter for victims of domestic violence called Safe+Sound Somerset held its fundraiser golf tournament at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J.\n\nThey loved it.\n\nThen they quit it.\n\n“Beautiful golf course. Beautiful facilities. We were treated well. But we couldn’t go back,” said Debbie Haroldsen, the charity’s acting executive director. President Trump’s campaign-trail comments about women and Mexicans had offended staff and clients. They found another course.\n\nIn Florida this year, the president’s politics attracted a new client for one of his businesses. Steven M. Alembik, a conservative activist, is planning a $600-per-seat gala at the Mar-a-Lago Club.\n\nHis logic: Trump helped Israel. So Alembik will help Trump in return.\n\n“He’s got Israel’s back,” Alembik said. “We’ve got his back.’”\n\nTrump’s divisive political career is reshaping a key — and previously apolitical — part of his business empire.\n\nTrump-owned hotels and clubs have long made money by holding galas and other special events. Now, their clientele is changing. Trump’s properties are attracting new customers who want something from him or his government.\n\nBut they’re losing the kind of customers the business was originally built on: nonpolitical groups who just wanted to rent a room.\n\nThis summer, 19 charities canceled upcoming events at Mar-a-Lago — a major blow to that club’s business — after the president said there were “fine people” among white supremacists, neo-Nazis and members of the alt-right protesting to preserve a Confederate statue in Charlottesville. Dozens of other clients have left since Trump entered the 2016 presidential race.\n\nOn Saturday, the latest cancellation: A triathlon for charity at Trump’s Charlotte golf course, called “Tri at the Trump,” was abruptly scrapped. Sign-ups were down this year, the organizer said, due to concerns over the name.\n\nFor the Trump Organization, a potentially troubling trend is emerging.\n\nBefore this year, many longtime Trump clients said they would return to use his clubs again — believing that quitting a Trump club would be a political act. Now, as Trump’s presidency has grown more polarizing, some customers say they see it as a political act to stay.\n\n“We are not a political organization,” said Mike Levin, whose charity Harlem Lacrosse this year moved its golf tournament away from a Trump course in New York state, after going there for two prior years. “Given the current political environment, we opted to reschedule for a different course.\n\nIn all, Trump owns 12 golf courses in the United States — 11 on the East Coast, and one outside Los Angeles. He owns at least a partial stake in four hotels, in the District, Chicago, Las Vegas and New York’s SoHo. And he owns Mar-a-Lago and a winery resort outside Charlottesville.\n\nTo assess the state of Trump’s hospitality business, The Washington Post reviewed public records, data released by the Trump Organization and social-media postings from Trump properties. The Post identified a sample of more than 200 groups that had rented out meeting rooms or golf courses at a Trump property since 2014.\n\nOf those groups, 85 are no longer Trump customers. Many said they left for nonpolitical reasons. But 30 told The Post that they had left because of Trump’s political career.\n\nThe Post provided its findings to the Trump Organization, which declined to provide a response or answer questions. A White House spokeswoman declined to comment, referring questions to the Trump Organization.\n\nThe Post’s review could not determine if the Trump Organization’s special-event business is growing or shrinking overall.\n\nBut it did show, clearly, that one part of that business is thriving. The business of political events.\n\nFor instance, in the 2014 election cycle, before Trump jumped into the presidential race, nine federal Republican candidates and committees reported patronizing Trump-owned properties.\n\nAltogether, these groups spent $32,499 over two years, less than Trump’s clubs could take in from a single run-of-the-mill golf tournament.\n\nThis year, the figures are different.\n\nAt least 27 federal political committees — including Trump’s reelection campaign — have flocked to his properties. They’ve spent $363,701 in just seven months, according to campaign-finance reports. In addition, the Republican Governors Association paid more than $408,000 to hold an event this spring at the Trump National Doral golf resort, according to tax filings, a gathering the group said was booked back in February 2015.\n\n\n\nTrump International Hotel in Washington. (Evelyn Hockstein/for The Washington Post)\n\nAt Trump’s D.C. hotel, there have also been a slew of events involving groups that have come to Washington to influence policy decisions.\n\nJust last week, the hotel hosted the prime minister of Malaysia, who is the subject of a Justice Department corruption probe, as well as the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, which wants more offshore drilling. The hotel was also scheduled to host an association of candy-makers, who want federal help in a long-running feud with the sugar industry.\n\nIn July, a trade group representing e-cigarette makers and vape shop owners brought about 150 people to the hotel. They paid $285 per guest room. They also paid to rent a ballroom, and reserve the hotel’s Lincoln Library, though the vapers wouldn’t say how much they cost.\n\nTen days after the group checked out, it scored a victory.\n\nAn Obama-era regulation requiring stricter government oversight of e-cigarette products was put on hold by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nTony Abboud, the executive director of the Vapor Technology Association, said in a recent interview that the FDA decision was based on the merits and unrelated to the group’s choice of venue. He said the Trump hotel was chosen as a matter of convenience.\n\n“We put this together very quickly,” he said.\n\nWhen asked whether the Trump hotel event had influenced the FDA’s decision, an agency spokesman said that the announcement was the “culmination of months-long internal discussions” about how to reduce tobacco-related deaths.\n\nRentals from groups such as these helped Trump’s D.C. hotel surpass its own revenue expectations.\n\nThrough the first four months of the year, the hotel turned a profit of $1.97 million, according to documents reported by The Post last month. Before the election, the company had projected it would lose $2.1 million in the same period, the documents show. The revenue from food and beverage sales — which include special events — was part of that surprising performance. It came in 37 percent above expectations.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. (Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nTrump’s politics was a draw for Alembik, the conservative Israel backer who decided recently to hold an event at Mar-a-Lago, the president’s oceanfront club in Palm Beach.\n\nAlembik said he will charge $600 per ticket. He expects 700 guests. That’s $420,000. In theory, Alembik said, any leftover proceeds will go to an Israeli charity called The Truth About Israel.\n\nBut, Alembik said, Trump’s club will probably keep most of the money. He said he’d recently seen an estimate of the costs. He declined to say what the number was, but said: “My God, they’re expensive. Holy crap.”\n\n“With what Mar-a-Lago charges,” he said, “I don’t think there’s going to be much left over.” Alembik was fine with the idea that he was putting money into the president’s pocket: “Yeah, and the other ones are taking money out of his pocket,” he said, meaning the charities that canceled after Charlottesville.\n\nAlembik’s event is unusual, in that he is explicit about using a ballroom rental as part of a political message to the president.\n\nMore broadly, however, many Trump clubs seem to be losing the customers that had been commonplace before.\n\nThat trend began in California in 2015, just after Trump said in his campaign announcement speech that Mexico was sending “rapists” to the United States. The L.A. Unified School District canceled a golf tournament. So did ESPN, the PGA, the L.A. Galaxy soccer team and the Union Rescue Mission.\n\nThe Post counted 11 special events at Trump’s California course in 2014. Now, 10 of those clients are gone.\n\nThose California departures made news.\n\nBut at other clubs, clients were also quietly deciding to leave.\n\n“A lot of the children that are in our program are immigrant children, [and] we didn’t want them to feel offended” by Trump’s comments about Mexicans, said Debra Green, of a youth-sports charity called Jeremy’s Heroes. For four years, her charity, named for a passenger who fought back against hijackers on Sept. 11, 2001, had used Trump’s golf course in Colts Neck, N.J., for its charity fundraiser.\n\nIn 2016, the group didn’t return.\n\nThat meant about $50,000 in lost business for Trump’s club.\n\n“We would not have changed the venue, but for that happening,” Green said. “The facilities, the service there, were all excellent.”\n\nAt Trump’s course in the Bronx, the drop is spelled out in figures provided to New York City, which owns the land under the course. The city data shows that the revenue from “outings” — events where the course is rented out by outside groups — declined 30 percent from 2015 to 2016 and is headed down again this year.\n\nOther courses appear to be experiencing declines. In Westchester County, N.Y., 14 of the 21 clients that The Post identified in 2014 are now gone.\n\nIn Colts Neck, N.J., 11 of 17 are gone. The losses included the Golf Classic of the Sisters of Mercy, a tournament that benefits retired nuns. “The sisters cannot participate in a political campaign or support a specific candidate,” a spokeswoman wrote.\n\nMost of those departing cited nonpolitical reasons for their decisions — such as the end of a contract, the price of the rental or a need for more event space.\n\nFor the Trump Organization, some clubs are doing better than others. At Trump’s course outside Charlotte — one of just three courses located in counties Trump won in 2016 — a number of new events have sprung up since 2014.\n\nBut even there, the Trump name can be a drag for the club’s customers.\n\nLike the organizer of “Tri at the Trump.”\n\n“A lot of people wouldn’t participate because of that,” said Chuck McAllister, who runs the triathlon, referring to the Trump name. The triathlon had used that name for three prior years. This year was different. Participant numbers were far below the high of 325-plus, set before Trump won the GOP nomination.\n\nMcAllister initially tried Sept. 11 to resolve the controversy, first reported by the Charlotte Observer, by changing the race’s name to Tri for Good.\n\nThat wasn’t enough.\n\n“I had some people sign up. And I had some people want out,” he told The Washington Post late in the week. “Probably a pretty even split.”\n\nFinally, on Saturday, he canceled the event. The situation “became way [too] politicized,” McAllister wrote in an email message.\n\n\n\nThe main entrance to the Trump National Doral Miami Golf Shop. (Angel Valentin/for The Washington Post)\n\nAt Trump Doral, a golf club and resort outside Miami, The Post identified 18 business conferences or golf tournaments scheduled to be held at the property from mid-September through next May.\n\nMany are sponsored by industry groups such as the Food Marketing Institute, which is hosting a conference for 1,000 food retailers and suppliers there in January. The group signed a contract to book the Doral back in April 2015, according to a spokeswoman.\n\nA major defense contractor, L3 Technologies, just announced that it would hold its annual management meeting at the resort. A spokeswoman said the company chose Doral for a variety of logistical reasons unrelated to politics.\n\nLast Tuesday, at Trump’s club in the New Jersey suburbs of Philadelphia, there was a tournament that epitomized the old business model for his events business. A charity tied to the Philadelphia Flyers hockey team held a celebrity golf tournament, with players teeing off and then gathering for fancy food.\n\nIt was the seventh year in a row the Flyers’ charity had come there.\n\nIt might be the last.\n\n“We’ve made the decision that we will explore other options” for 2018, said Scott Tharp, the president of the Flyers’ charity, the Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation. He was worried about the tournament being seen as a political statement.\n\nNext year, Tharp said, “It’s going to be very hard to replace this venue.”\n\nJonathan O’Connell, Drew Harwell, Anu Narayanswamy and Alice Crites contributed to this report.","author":"David A.

Trump’s retweets of outlandish memes a signal to his base","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rts--endorsements-trumps-retweets-of-outlandish-memes-a-signal-to-his-base/2017/09/17/ff0e746c-9bd7-11e7-8ea1-ed975285475e_story.html","text":"Over the past 2½ months, President Trump has retweeted to the more than 30 million followers of his personal Twitter account these pieces of highbrow social media content:\n\n●An animated GIF of him executing some WWE-style ground-and-pound on a CNN avatar.\n\n●A cartoon meme of a “Trump train” running over a hapless CNN reporter.\n\n●On Sunday, another doctored GIF of him hitting a golf ball into Hillary Clinton so hard she falls over.\n\nDo these retweets equal an endorsement? For Trump, they probably do, but the White House isn’t saying, and it doesn’t really matter.\n\nGiven a boost by the tweeter in chief, the attacks on Trump’s enemies, content dredged from the depths of the Internet’s mud pits, are amplified, spread virally and instantly transmitted into the center of nation’s daily political discourse — “liked” by hundreds of thousands of Trump’s supporters and seen by countless more in breathless news reports.\n\nMuch has been made of the president’s use of social media to dominate the media bandwidth during the campaign and, since taking office, his penchant to lay bare his id in real time despite repeated efforts by White House handlers to curtail him. On Sunday, Trump, in his own words, mocked North Korea’s Kim Jong Un on Twitter, calling the dictator with a growing nuclear weapons arsenal the “Rocket Man.”\n\nYet if Trump’s bombast on social media has alarmed foreign leaders, confused Congress and moved financial markets, his strategy of retweeting memes and GIFs has a different effect, media experts said. At a time when Trump’s public approval ratings have tumbled and he is taking fire from conservatives for flirting with bipartisanship on immigration, the president’s promotion of the outlandish content — created and distributed by his most ardent supporters — aims to rally his far-right political base.\n\n“Last week, he met with Democrats, and a lot in the base were kind of pissed off,” said Nikki Usher, an assistant professor at George Washington University’s School of Media and Public Affairs. “Now he’s signaling to them: ‘I found this stuff [online]. Isn’t it cool? I’m listening to you.’ It’s a reaffirmation to the base that they really matter.”\n\nThe tactics strike Trump’s critics as distasteful at best and harmful at worse; some liberals and media columnists have accused the president of promoting violence against reporters and sexism against female politicians. The Twitter user whose Clinton golf GIF Trump retweeted Sunday has an account handle that relies on the phonetic spelling of the f-word.\n\nDespite the howls of outrage, Trump can claim a win, Usher said. The Internet, she said, has produced a “remix culture” in which anyone can produce content. By that measure, some of the content Trump is retweeting is “brilliant” as parody or comedy and is clearly intended as a joke, she said.\n\n“The mainstream media and progressives say this stuff is threatening and dangerous and calls for violence, but then Trump supporters say these folks can’t even take a joke,” she said. “He wins in that regard. And the other appeal is that members of his base have a horrible, deep-seated hatred of Hillary Clinton.”\n\nIn addition to the golf GIF, Trump retweeted other memes Sunday. One showed his face with stock market arrows pointing up, another showed a Trump train plowing through a snowstorm, and a third showed image of the U.S. electoral map covered in Republican red with the words “keep it up Libs. This will be 2020.”\n\nCritics said Trump has not only coarsened and debased the nation’s dialogue, but also that he has promoted xenophobia and anti-Semitism. During the campaign, Trump promoted a meme of Clinton with the words “most corrupt candidate ever” emblazoned on a six-pointed star of David. As president, Trump has retweeted users who, journalists later discovered, have made other racist or anti-Semitic statements.\n\nTo Macon Phillips, who served as the White House’s director of new media under President Barack Obama, Trump’s choices of what he retweets demonstrate a lack of interest in growing his base and at the same time highlight the narrow political space in which the president has room to operate.\n\n“The fact that he routinely retweets people with a checkered history and viewpoints reflects the slim pickings he has to go with” of supporter-created pro-Trump content, Phillips said.\n\nIt is not clear whether Trump retweets the memes himself or relies on aides, such as White House social media director Dan Scavino. Nor is it known how Trump discovers the material, given that he follows just 45 people on Twitter from his personal account.\n\nTrump aides did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn recent months, Trump has flubbed a couple of retweets. In one case, he retweeted and thanked a supporter who does not appear to be real person but whose persona was invented to promote a Trump-related apparel store. In another case last month, Trump retweeted a user from Britain who called him a “fascist.”\n\nAsked about the president’s retweets Sunday, Republican strategist David Urban replied: “I’m not going to judge what’s appropriate and inappropriate with the president. Retweets do not equal endorsement. I think it says in the bottom of this tweet.”\n\nThere is, in fact, no such disclaimer.","author":"David Nakamura, David Nakamura","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T12:02:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/09/17/National-Politics/Images/d_Nations_General_Assembly_Whats_Ahead_60683-3d49f.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"TqaaTyRxq74pZIzDsx7gBA==\n"}

(Maxim Mints/Vimeo)\n\nGeorgia Tech police shot and killed the president of the Pride Alliance student group Saturday night in full view of dorm residents.\n\nPolice encountered Scout Schultz, a 21-year-old computer engineering student who identified as neither male nor female, in a parking lot outside the dorms after someone called 911 to report “a person with a knife and a gun,” according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.\n\nSchultz didn’t appear to be holding a gun in video recorded from a window above the parking lot, as the campus was placed on lockdown shortly before midnight. But the student was armed with a knife, the bureau wrote in a statement — and video shows officers repeatedly telling Schultz to drop the weapon as the student advances.\n\n\n\nScout Schultz (via Facebook)\n\n“Come on man, let’s drop the knife,” an officer with his gun drawn says in the graphic video. But Schultz walks toward him.\n\n“Shoot me!”\n\nThe officer keeps backing up, moving behind a parking barricade and imploring again: “Nobody wants to hurt you, man.”\n\nAt least four officers had surrounded Schultz by then, according to WSB-TV. In the dorm-window video, one of the officers called out to the student, who consequently turned away from the barricade and began to move toward the new voice.\n\n“What are we doing here?” the officer asked.

Tillerson arrived in Qatar to try and mediate a dispute between the energy-rich country and its Gulf neighbours. (Alexander W. Riedel/U.S. State Department via AP) (Alexander W. Riedel/via AP)\n\nMore than three months after it began, the Persian Gulf dispute that has driven a deep wedge between America’s closest allies in the region appears no closer to resolution.\n\nThe Trump administration, which depends on the gulf states as its main air and sea launchpad for the fight against the Islamic State, and as a bulwark against Iran, is starting to get worried.\n\n“We have an awful lot of equities here,” a U.S. official said. “Is it acceptable that American business starts reporting to us that contracts are getting canceled because of the climate in the gulf?” Or that the air base “from which we rain down holy hell” on militants in Syria and Iraq is endangered? Or a unified Arab bulwark against Iran is fraying?\n\n“We’re all starting to feel . . . that the Qatar crisis gets in the way of things we want to do,” said the official.\n\nThe initial eruption came days after President Trump proclaimed the gulf allies united during a visit to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in late May. Charging that Qatar was financing terrorists and trying to undermine their governments, four nations in the region — gulf monarchies Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, joined by Egypt — broke relations and closed their air, land and sea borders to the tiny, energy-rich peninsula at the Straits of Hormuz.\n\nSince then, the protagonists on both sides have waged a public war of insults and accusations, much of it through shrill, ­multimillion-dollar U.S. lobbying campaigns targeting political opinion in Washington.\n\nThe largest political ad buy of the summer came from an organization called the Saudi American Public Relation Affairs Committee, SAPRAC, which spent $1.6 million on television spots on local news and Washington broadcasts of national programs, according to data provided to The Washington Post by CMAG-Kantar Media, which tracks television advertising.\n\n“One country in the gulf region is a threat to global security,” intones the narrator of the ad over doomsday music. “President Trump, Qatar cannot be trusted.”\n\nHome to a crucial air base and more than 10,000 U.S. service members, Qatar has been cited in the past by U.S. officials for lax control over terrorist financing. But officials have also noted recent progress, and few appear to believe that Qatar’s sins are much worse than those of others in the region. Instead, many chalk up the conflict to what one person involved in U.S. efforts to end it called “personal animosity” among the gulf’s ruling families, and differing outlooks on how best to keep themselves in power.\n\nU.S. and foreign officials who discussed the crisis spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid fueling an already inflamed dispute.\n\nAt the beginning, it was Trump who spread the fire, with his open support of the accusations against Qatar. While Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis avoided blame and called for negotiations, Trump hailed the “wisdom” of Saudi King Salman, reveled in Saudi purchases of U.S. arms, pointed a finger at Qatar’s capital, Doha, and said the United States could launch its counterterrorism warplanes from somewhere else.\n\nDuring the summer, Tillerson and Jared Kushner, Trump’s White House adviser and son-in-law, traveled separately to the region. In August, Tillerson sent two U.S. envoys to the gulf, but no progress was reported.\n\nIt was not until early September, after months of cajoling from Tillerson and Mattis, that Trump apparently decided it was time to put an end to the spat. “What you’re seeing now is the White House trying to push this, to say enough is enough, before it begins to affect military operations,” an official said.\n\nAt a Sept. 7 news conference with the visiting emir of Kuwait, whose own mediation efforts have been unsuccessful, Trump said he might have to bring the parties to the White House and handle the negotiations himself.\n\n“Very quickly, I think, we’ll have something solved,” he said.\n\nIn telephone talks the next day with leaders of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Trump facilitated a call between them.\n\nBut any rapprochement was short-lived. Within hours, both governments had publicly claimed that the other had blinked first and sought the dialogue. The effort was officially suspended.\n\nThe failure of Trump’s personal diplomacy has left the United States with few options. There is little reason to think that the president, who plans to meet with some leaders from the region during the U.N. General Assembly, will have much better luck in person.\n\nTillerson has gone out of his way to bolster Qatar, calling demands by the Saudi-led quartet unreasonable and signing a new memorandum of understanding on terrorism financing with Doha. But the administration has left itself little leverage with the other side, unless Trump is willing to sacrifice arms sales and other ­Saudi-U.S. business deals, or temper his own fulsome praise for Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the principal Saudi partner in the fight against Qatar.\n\nThe Saudis and Emiratis have diligently courted the Trump White House. Even before the May presidential visit to Riyadh, according to U.S. intelligence, they were planning a new offensive in their long-running dispute with Qatar, correctly concluding that Trump would be sympathetic.\n\nSmall Qatar has long irked its neighbors by pursuing an impertinent foreign policy that they think contradicts their interests. A list of their 13“nonnegotiable” demands includes an end to Qatari support for political Islamic movements; , including the Muslim Brotherhood; closing Al Jazeera; , the state-funded Qatari media company;reducing ties with Iran, with which Qatar shares the world’s largest gas field; and ejecting political dissidents who come from quartet countries.\n\nQatar has said it will talk with its accusers but will not agree to anything that impinges on its sovereignty.\n\nAs U.S. policymakers wring their hands, the main beneficiaries of the dispute so far are the lobbying firms each side has hired to influence Washington, as reflected in their filings under the Justice Department’s Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\nIn August, the Podesta Group retroactively registered for work it had done since June on behalf of SAPRAC, the Saudi purchaser of the television ads, at a monthly fee of $50,000, not including production and other expenses or marked-up media buys.\n\nThat fee is relatively small compared with the multiple other firms employed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, some recently, and some on the payroll for years with monthly or quarterly fees in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nQatar has been a relative latecomer to the all-out influence war, but it has gone on a hiring spree since early summer.\n\nRather than attacking its accusers, Qatar has focused on print and online ads emphasizing its close security ties with the United States and its own counterterrorism efforts. South Carolina-based Nelson, Mullins, Riley \u0026 Scarborough was hired at $100,000 a month in July to “build political capital” and relationships for Qatar, and to ensure “the right information is out there, and the right people know it,” said Christopher T. Kushing, the firm’s managing director for public strategies.\n\nAvenue Strategies, a firm tied to Trump campaign officials, is being paid $150,000 a month for “strategic consulting services,” and former attorney general John D. ­Ashcroft’s law firm received a $2.5 million retainer for “evaluating, verifying, and as necessary, strengthening [Qatar’s] anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financial compliance programs,” according to the filings.\n\nAs far as the administration is concerned, however, the question of who is right has faded when compared with the potential damage of the dispute itself. The message to the gulf leaders, an official said, is that the cacophony of paid voices “is ham-handed, and they’re being taken to the cleaners by those guys.”\n\n“We’re trying to tell them to knock it off.”\n\nTom Hamburger and Julie Tate contributed to this report.","author":"Karen DeYoung, Karen DeYoung","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T11:15:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/09/15/National-Security/Images/Qatar_Tillerson_17052-0606e-0745.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"r27kikch/xpog9Asw9bGdQ==\n"}

(Jacob Hannah/For The Washington Post)\n\nDoug Greenwood lifted his shirt to let his doctor probe his belly, scarred from past surgeries, for tender spots. Searing abdominal pain had landed Greenwood in the emergency room a few weeks earlier, and he’d come for a follow-up visit to Cold Hollow Family Practice, a big red barnlike building perched on the edge of town.\n\nAfter the appointment was over and his blood was drawn, Greenwood stayed for an entirely different exam: of his life. Anne-Marie Lajoie, a nurse care coordinator, began to map out Greenwood’s financial resources, responsibilities, transportation options, food resources and social supports on a sheet of paper. A different picture began to emerge of the 58-year-old male patient recovering from diverticulitis: Greenwood had moved back home, without a car or steady work, to care for his mother, who suffered from dementia. He slept in a fishing shanty in the yard, with a baby monitor to keep tabs on his mother.\n\nThis more expansive checkup is part of a pioneering effort in this New England state to keep people healthy while simplifying the typical jumble of private and public insurers that pays for health care.\n\nThe underlying premise is simple: Reward doctors and hospitals financially when patients are healthy, not just when they come in sick.\n\nIt’s an idea that has been percolating through the health-care system in recent years, supported by the Affordable Care Act and changes to how Medicare pays for certain kinds of care, such as hip and knee replacements.\n\nJohn Graves sits in his apartment in South Burlington, Vt. He lives at an apartment complex that is part of a program to provide housing for former homeless people, as well as help them enroll in health care and other programs. (Jacob Hannah/For The Washington Post)\n\nBut Vermont is setting an ambitious goal of taking its alternative payment model statewide and applying it to 70 percent of insured state residents by 2022 which — if it works — could eventually lead to fundamental changes in how Americans pay for health care.\n\n“You make your margin off of keeping people healthier, instead of doing more operations. This drastically changes you, from wanting to do more of a certain kind of surgery to wanting to prevent them,” said Stephen Leffler, chief population health and quality officer of the University of Vermont Health Network.\n\nMaking lump sum payments, instead of paying for each X-ray or checkup, changes the financial incentives for doctors. For example, spurring the state’s largest hospital system to invest in housing. Or creating more roles like Lajoie’s, focused on diagnosing problems with housing, transportation, food and other services that affect people’s well-being.\n\nCritics, however, worry that it will create a powerful tier of middlemen charged with administering health-care payments without sufficient oversight. Those middlemen are Accountable Care Organizations, networks of hospitals and doctors that work to coordinate care and can share in the rewards if providers are able to save health-care costs, but remain on the hook if costs run too high. In Vermont, the goal is to limit the growth in overall annual health care spending to 3.5 percent each year.\n\nIt will put a new burden on primary care doctors to keep people healthy — potentially punishing providers financially for patients’ deep-rooted habits and behaviors. And the core idea of increasing outreach to high-risk patients, though sensible on its surface, may not control health spending; one study found the approach was unlikely to yield net savings.\n\n“I think this kind of model could be very good if it’s implemented the right way. There’s a big question on whether it will be implemented the right way,” said Amy Cooper, executive director of HealthFirst, an association of independent physicians in Vermont.\n\nThe current initiative is Vermont’s second attempt to revolutionize health care. It was the first state in the country to embrace a government-financed universal health-care system but abandoned the plan in late 2014 because of concerns over costs.\n\nTo hear Al Gobeille, a restaurateur turned Vermont human services secretary, tell it, paying for insurance coverage is just one of the big problems facing the American health-care system. The other, even more complicated one is reducing the underlying cost — and that is what Vermont is trying to tackle.\n\nIn 2015, a health insurance plan cost a family $24,000 in premiums, Gobeille said, and by 2025, that is projected to grow to $42,000.\n\n“There’s going to be a calamity. No family is going to be able to afford that,” Gobeille said. “So it’s important to move to a system that aligns more closely to the growth of our economy.”\n\nThis year, 30,000 Medicaid patients — like Greenwood — have transitioned into the experimental model through a pilot run by the accountable care organization OneCare Vermont. The system uses software to flag people with complex medical needs and chronic health conditions and to coordinate care and support for those deemed at high risk. Instead of billing for each overnight stay or medical scan, hospitals receive an upfront monthly payment to manage the care for every patient assigned to them, and primary care practices receive payments to help with the outreach work.\n\n“It’s creating a situation where the physicians and hospital leaders and other clinicians in Vermont feel like they have enough support and structure around them that they can fundamentally pursue changes in their clinical models and their business models,” said Andrew Garland, vice president of external affairs and client relations at BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont. “It has us all rowing in the same direction.”\n\nGarland said BlueCross is in discussions to move a segment of its members — including individuals and small businesses who buy plans through its Affordable Care Act exchange — into the new payment model next year.\n\nOther states are embarking on similar efforts to cut health-care spending, on both sides of the partisan divide.\n\nArkansas’ Medicaid program has collaborated with private insurers to shift payments around discrete “episodes of care” — such as asthma and congestive heart failure. “By having Medicaid and Blue Cross on the same page, we got the providers’ attention,” said William Golden, medical director of the medical services division at the Arkansas Department of Human Services.\n\nIn 2014, Maryland started giving hospitals an upfront budget for the year, to incentivize providers to keep patients healthy.\n\n“The real magic here is when you get the payers — Medicare, Medicaid and the commercial payers, saying the same thing to the delivery system. Vermont is trying to do it one way . . . Arkansas is trying to do it with more coordination between Medicaid and Blue Cross,” said Christopher Koller, president of the Milbank Memorial Fund, a foundation focused on improving health. “States like Maryland, Vermont are really trying to get at the underlying cost.”\n\nAs Vermont retools how it pays for health care, the health system itself is already evolving — with an emphasis on services that fall far outside the traditional domain of medicine.\n\n[Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) introduces universal health care]\n\nVermont’s major hospital system has put up the money to allow community partners to buy and refurbish housing, building off earlier success of buying blocks of nights for temporary stays at a motel run by the Champlain Housing Trust. After three years, costs for hospital stays dropped by $1.6 million, accompanied by a large drop in readmissions.\n\nThat led the University of Vermont Medical Center to put up the cash this year to enable the housing trust to buy and convert a roadside motel in Burlington into a landing spot for patients who don’t need to be in a hospital, but don’t have a suitable place to return.\n\nA hospital-owned family medicine practice in Colchester has set up “health-care share” day on Thursdays, when families can pick up a box of fresh vegetables prescribed by their family doctor.\n\nKari Potter, 34, said that the farm share has changed how her family eats. She makes all her own sauces, she said, loading a bag of veggies and two chickens into her car, and the weekly delivery has helped the kids learn to appreciate healthy snacks, even just thinly sliced cucumbers.\n\nMost of these changes seem sensible, and they may even improve patient health. The question will be whether they save money in the long run. In Vermont, there are fears that only the biggest hospital systems that have the wiggle room to assume risk and sustain financial losses will survive.\n\nIt is also unclear how patients will react, as the pilot is expanded beyond Medicaid recipients.\n\nDuring his appointment, Greenwood was firm that he had no real complaints about his life and didn’t think he needed any particular support.\n\n“Any problems with depression or anxiety?” Lajoie asked. Greenwood said no and Lajoie gently tried to prod him for more information — “meaning you don’t have any sadness feelings?”\n\n“No,” Greenwood said. “If I do, they ain’t bad.”\n\nWhen she asked if his health ever got in the way of visiting friends, he chuckled.\n\n“I don’t visit with friends,” Greenwood replied. “Just watch soap operas.”\n\nLajoie made notes to revisit his chewing tobacco habit and find out if he needed additional support in a month. The trick to this job is finding the ways that they can support people, which may not always be obvious — to the care coordinator or to the patient.\n\n“We’re not here to judge them or anything. Sometimes we don’t understand what we can actually help them with,” Lajoie said. “It’s a learning thing, together.”","author":"Carolyn Y. Johnson, Carolyn Y.

(Halldor Kolbeins/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn 2004, Hjalti Sigurjon Hauksson was imprisoned for raping his stepdaughter nearly every day for 12 years, starting when she was just 5. Thirteen years later, his crime has helped bring down Iceland's government.\n\nThe story involves Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson and his father, Benedikt Sveinsson.\n\nHere's what happened: Several months ago, Sveinsson drafted a letter of recommendation for Hauksson, arguing that he should have his “honor restored.” In Iceland, convicts can have certain civil rights restored by submitting letters of recommendation extolling good character. Hauksson and another convicted pedophile, Robert Downey (formerly named Robert Arni Hreidarsson), received full pardons over the summer.\n\nThose decisions “rattled Icelandic society,” according to Iceland Magazine. As a reporter explains: “Public and media have spent much of summer discussing the two cases and the horrifying world of violence and abuse they revealed.”\n\n[Iceland ousted one leader named in the Panama Papers, but ended up with another on the list]\n\nSoon after, one of Downey's victims launched a campaign urging the government to release the letters of support for Downey and Hauksson. But the Justice Ministry refused to respond to questions on the matter.\n\nThis week, a parliamentary committee ruled that the administration was violating freedom-of-information laws by keeping the names a secret. So the letters were released to the news media. Even more damning: On Thursday, Iceland's justice minister, Sigridur Andersen, told television news reporters that she had informed the prime minister of his father's involvement in July. She said she told no one else.\n\nThat disclosure, which smacked of a coverup, sent shock waves through Iceland's political class and threatened the fragile three-party coalition that put Benediktsson in power last year.\n\n[The Bernie Sanders of Iceland is a Pirate, a poet and possibly the country’s next leader]\n\nTo secure a majority, his Independence Party joined forces with the centrists and the Bright Future coalition, squeaking in with a razor-thin majority of 32 out of 63 seats. On Friday, Bright Future voted unanimously to leave the government. The letter “was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” a Bright Future insider told the news agency Reuters. “This is not in our spirit, and everybody agreed this was the end of it. It came as a complete surprise. It was something we couldn’t have continued with, this is something completely opposed to our principles. The corruption and dishonesty are just incredible.”\n\nBright Future's decision left Benediktsson without a majority. He called his behavior a “serious breach of trust” and dissolved his government. “We have lost the majority, and I don't see anything that indicates we can regain that,” he told reporters. He has called for speedy elections, aiming for November.\n\nThis isn't Benediktsson's first controversy. His name and his father's appeared in the Panama Papers, connected to offshore tax havens and a controversial sale of state assets.\n\n[Who killed a woman in one of the world’s safest countries? All of Iceland wants to know.]\n\nIn a statement, Benediktsson's father apologized for signing the letter of support for Hauksson, an old friend. “I have never considered the restored honor as anything except a legal procedure making it possible for convicted criminals to regain some civil rights,” Sveinsson said, according to the BBC. “I did not think of it as something that would justify Hjalti's position toward his victim. I told Hjalti to face his action and to repent.”\n\nHauksson's victim called the situation surreal. In interviews with Icelandic media, she said Hauksson has continued to harass her, even approaching her 6-year-old daughter while she was on a field trip. Hauksson was working as a bus driver at the time.","author":"Amanda Erickson, Amanda Erickson","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-16T09:21:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-01-10/Getty/AFP_JT7A1.jpg?t=20170517","digest":"yMb4Fa+6RfvofEG4LTcTlQ==\n"}

But first, a SPOILER ALERT! Don’t read this until you’ve seen Sunday’s episode of Outlander.\n\nIn the final scene of the second episode, the camera pulls away from the action to find Claire (Caitriona Balfe) and Frank (Tobias Menzies) sleeping in separate twin beds. It’s like a scene out of I Love Lucy — except Ricky and Lucy still adored each other, even though they didn’t share the same mattress. That’s definitely not the case for Claire and Frank.\n\n“In many ways, the relationship we all want is Claire and Jamie but the relationship most of us get or have had experience with is the one between Claire and Frank,” Balfe tells EW. “It just feels very real and it’s tragic. These are two good people, they’re trying to do their best, but they’re never going to be able to give each other what they need. That’s very fertile ground for good drama.”\n\nBalfe said she and Menzies worked hard to make sure the couple’s time together in the 20th century wasn’t simply an exercise in “oh they’re unhappy and they hate each other.”\n\n“Obviously they’re unhappy but you can’t live with somebody for 20 years unless you find moments of joy and mutual respect, and there is love there even though it’s platonic,” Balfe explains. “I think it’s really heartbreaking when you see moments of them as they were way back in the beginning of season 1. They enjoy each other’s company and that they’re both smart people. Intellectually, they stimulate each other. But there’s just too much there, there’s too much pain and there’s too much disappointment. That will always be the thing that bubbles up and drives them apart.”\n\nGoing forward, expect the chasm to grow even wider, teases Menzies.\n\n“As we head into the ‘60s, you see Brianna growing up and them drifting. They start to live quite separate lives,” he explains. “They cobble together a relationship that kind of works for the child.

He may not say a lot, but he conveys multitudes.\n\nThis second episode fast forwards six years in the Scot’s story — a necessary jump seeing as he’s spent the time since his return to Lallybroch holed up in a cave, living a solitary life as an outlaw. (On the next episode of Cavefront Property Hunt!) Sure, he does stop into Lallybroch from time to time to see his family and tend to paperwork, but if his Hagrid makeover is any indication of his internal life, Jamie is feeling isolated and despondent. His time in hiding has also inspired new lore: Not only is he renowned as Red Jamie, but he’s also gained the moniker The Dunbonnet, owing to the beige cap he sports to conceal his immediately recognizable locks. And so it is that the Red Coats descend upon Lallybroch in search of the notorious Dunbonnet (a.k.a Red Jamie).\n\n“No one here goes by that name,” says brother-in-law Ian, who is nonetheless carted away under suspicion of harboring a fugitive. (Don’t worry — he’ll be back by episode’s end.) Meanwhile, a pregnant Jenny bluffs and says that they haven’t seen him since he left for the rebellion six years before. It’s not really a lie, though, as she tells Jamie later while he’s skinning a buck: “James Fraser hasn’t been here for a long, long time.”\n\nJamie’s dependable companion Fergus, for one, isn’t giving up on him just yet. Armed with the pistol he found hidden in a storehouse, he creeps to Jamie’s cave for an unannounced shooting lesson. After all, he needs to be ready for the next rebellion.\n\n“There will be no next rebellion,” Jamie replies. He instructs Fergus to get rid of the gun, as firearms are no longer permitted in the Highlands, but of course Fergus doesn’t do that. In fact, back at Lallybroch, when Fergus sees a raven roosted atop the house as Jenny goes into labor, he uses said gun to shoot the bad omen dead — and accidentally gains the attention of a roving bad of Red Coats. The soldiers charge into the house while a just-arrived Jamie is inside holding his newborn nephew. Jamie hides with the babe while Jenny tries to get them to leave. (Seriously, she just gave birth and is having to deal with this male nonsense!) The Red Coats’ line of questioning is relentless and increasingly invasive. When Jenny lies and says she gave birth to a still-born (to explain where the bern has gone), they actually ask to see the body! It looks as though Jamie will have to reveal himself until the maid walks in with the pistol — confiscated from Fergus — and takes the blame for the crime. As she’s a harmless gentlewoman, her indiscretion is excused .\n\nBut the Red Coats are not so generous with Fergus, who’s been taunting them every chance he gets. Later, while in the woods near Jamie’s cave, the young Frenchman comes upon the band of soldiers and tries to lure them away from his employer’s hiding place. Jamie watches these events transpire but can do nothing because to intercede would mean not only his own demise but his family’s too. The confrontation escalates to the point where a fallen Fergus has his hand chopped clean off by a Red Coat! Why his hand, you ask? Well, in Voyager — Diana Gabaldon’s novel upon which this season is based — Fergus’ hand is targeted because he is carrying a flask of ale he won’t turn over to the soldiers. But that detail has been omitted for the TV adaptation, so this bloody act feels rather inexplicable.\n\nAs gruesome as this turn of events is (the spurting!), there is a small silver lining for Fergus. After being carried back to Lallybroch and bandaged up, Fergus reminds Jamie of the bargain they struck up at the beginning of his service: If he were to ever lose an ear or a hand, Jamie would support him for the rest of his life. “In one stroke, I have become a man of leisure, huh?” Fergus asks Jamie.\n\nFor Jamie, the assault serves as a wake-up call. “You remind me I have something to fight for,” he tells Fergus. And with that new resolve, Jamie is moved to action: He hatches a plan to insure his family’s future safety and benefit them financially. As you’ll recall, there’s a bounty on Jamie’s head — one that he insists his sister take full advantage of. Jenny is, of course, appalled, and initially refuses Jamie’s plan. She’s eventually convinced, though, and the game is a foot.\n\nBut not before Jamie gets a last-minute conjugal visit in the cave. It’s Mary MacNab, the maid from before. She’s a widow and is also in need (if you know what I mean). She assures Jamie that this act is not meant to wipe away the memory of his wife, and they ostensibly have sex. It’s an interesting decision on the part of the writers not to show this particular sex scene…\n\nAnd so it is, a freshly shaved and shorn Jamie returns to Lallybroch…and into the arms of the awaiting British ambush.

After scoring 21 points in a season-opening win over the lowly New York Jets, the Bills' defeat was a reminder their offense stands to hold them back from competing for a playoff spot this season.\n\nTyrod Taylor threw for only 15 yards in the first half, and LeSean McCoy gained a net of zero yards on three carries over the first two quarters. Overall, the Bills' offense gained only 39 net yards on 16 plays in the first half -- and 176 yards for the entire game. That was their lowest output since a 160-yard afternoon in the 2016 season opener against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nJulius Peppers and the Panthers defense held Bills QB Tyrod Taylor in check all day. AP Photo/Mike McCarn\n\nWhat it means: Some Bills fans have called for the team to start quarterback Nathan Peterman since the fifth-round rookie's performance was generally superior to Taylor's in the preseason. It is too early for the Bills to make the switch from Taylor to Peterman, but Taylor did not help his case Sunday. He stood in the pocket too long, allowing three sacks and appeared unable to drive the ball downfield. However, it would be completely unfair to pin all of the Bills' offensive problems on Taylor, who continues to work without much top-line talent at receiver. But if a franchise quarterback makes those around him better, then Taylor continues to prove he is not good enough for that label.\n\nWhat the Bills did well: The offense's pitiful performance spoiled a commendable effort by the Bills' defense to hold the Panthers to six points through the first three quarters, despite staying on the field for nearly two-thirds of the game on a warm Carolina afternoon. The Bills sacked Cam Newton six times for 50 lost yards. Defensive end Jerry Hughes led the way with two sacks, while safety Jordan Poyer followed up on a strong opening-day performance with multiple plays on the ball Sunday. The Bills held the Panthers to 0-for-3 in their red zone tries.\n\nWhat you need to know in the NFL\n\n• Statistics\n\n• Scoreboard\n\n• 2017 schedule, results\n\n• Standings\n\nWhat the Bills did not do well: A significant part of the blame for Taylor's afternoon should fall on Taylor's receivers for not being open, and for Buffalo's management for not giving Taylor better options in the passing game. Before the Bills' final possession, top wide receivers Jordan Matthews and Zay Jones were targeted a total of four times. Jones finished with two catches for 18 yards, while Matthews had three catches for 30 yards. Buffalo continues to suffer in the short term from their August trade of Sammy Watkins, which the team hopes will pay off in the long term with the acquisition of the Rams' second-round pick in 2018.\n\nFantasy fallout: It was a nightmare afternoon for McCoy's fantasy owners. He finished with 9 yards on 12 carries, as well as six catches for 34 yards. At an initial glance, McCoy's snap count seemed lower than in the season opener, with No. 2 runner Mike Tolbert receiving more work against his former team. On the final play of the third quarter, McCoy jogged off the field holding his right arm awkwardly. He returned on the next play, but McCoy's performance Sunday might be a sign that his health could be holding him back. He was also held out of Friday's practice with groin soreness.\n\nBills' good health takes a hit: Buffalo entered Sunday's game as one of the NFL's healthiest teams, with only defensive lineman Jerel Worthy (concussion) ruled out for the contest and only two players on injured reserve. However, a couple of key players were injured. Defensive tackle Marcell Dareus missed time in the first half with an ankle injury and left tackle Cordy Glenn was sidelined in the second half also with an ankle injury. Dareus returned to the game while Glenn did not.\n\nWhat’s next: The Bills (1-1) return home to New Era Field next Sunday to host the Denver Broncos. After Buffalo's receivers struggled against the Panthers' secondary, the outlook is not good for their matchups against talented Denver cornerbacks Chris Harris and Aqib Talib. The Bills' best bet for a win is to shut down Broncos quarterback Trevor Siemian.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T19:57:17.000Z"},"source":"espn","urlToImage":"http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0917%2Fr259977_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"kiD4ezCv+4187o99yvNMiQ==\n"}

Ann Dowd nabbed the trophy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her work on Hulu’s acclaimed The Handmaid’s Tale at the 69th annual Emmy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday.\n\n“Well, I think this is a dream,” a tearful Dowd said. “I know it’s an actor’s dream and I’m deeply grateful to you. I don’t have the words, so I thank you.”\n\nThe actress plays Aunt Lydia, one of the few women with power — misguided, of course — on the series based on Margaret Atwood’s novel. In the militarized world of Gilead, she taught fertile women (a.k.a. “handmaids”) their new way of life, assigned them to the elite families looking to bear children using them, and punished them when they strayed from the oppressive rules they had to follow. Dowd toes the line between coming off maternal and intimidating in the role, and says the series should be more than entertainment.\n\n“I think of the show’s quote, ‘We didn’t look up from our phones until it was too late,'” Dowd told EW in June. “What we can do with The Handmaid’s Tale is put a voice to despair, to [inform others] to stay awake and alert. This is not the time to sit back and say, well, it’s not going to get any worse. This is the time to stand up every single time and say, no, not happening.”\n\nDowd, who was also nominated for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her work as Patti Levin on HBO’s The Leftovers, beat out her Handmaid’s Tale co-star Samira Wiley, along with fellow nominees Millie Bobby Brown (Stranger Things), Uzo Aduba (Orange Is the New Black), Chrissy Metz (This Is Us), and Thandie Newton (Westworld).","author":"Shirley Li","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-18T01:28:22.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-17-at-9-26-51-pm-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px\u0026resize=1200%2C630","digest":"up7ltdF7bO++fbjd3lWmKQ==\n"}

Brownfield joins a growing list of senior officers leaving the U.S. Foreign Service.","title":"For veteran drug warrior and diplomat, retirement comes with tinge of regret","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/for-veteran-drug-warrior-and-diplomat-retirement-comes-with-tinge-of-regret/2017/09/15/9ad1b6d2-9987-11e7-a527-3573bd073e02_story.html","text":"William R. Brownfield, assistant secretary of state in charge of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, testifies during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing last month. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/Associated Press)\n\nTo the extent that diplomacy is a kind of performance art, few U.S. Foreign Service officers have practiced it over the past several decades with as much flair as William R. Brownfield.\n\nWith his deadpan humor, theatrical delivery and a fondness for red suspenders, Brownfield is among the more distinctive personalities in a U.S. diplomatic corps typically known for caution and reticence.\n\nIn Latin America, where he spent much of his career, Brownfield has been a popular and sometimes notorious figure, as an irritant to the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez as well as one of the chief architects of the $10 billion Plan Colombia security aid package that helped end the country’s half-century civil conflict.\n\nThe Trump administration’s talk of ramping up the drug war made Brownfield a leading candidate for the job of assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs, the top U.S. diplomat in the Americas. Instead, he will retire this month after nearly 40 years in the Foreign Service, adding to the list of seasoned U.S. diplomats leaving the government.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson has moved slowly to fill key high-level posts, and critics say multiple departures are further hollowing out the country’s diplomatic corps. Each of the State Department’s regional assistant secretary jobs — critical to crafting and implementing U.S. foreign policy — is held by someone in an acting role.\n\nBrownfield is one of only three remaining diplomats with the title of career ambassador, the highest distinction in the Foreign Service. His wife, Kristie Kenney, a three-time ambassador, also held that rank, but she retired this year after she was demoted from her job as State Department counselor and stripped of her staff.\n\nEver the loyal soldier, Brownfield openly betrays no hard feelings toward President Trump or Tillerson. Brownfield points out that at 65 he has reached the age when Foreign Service officers are expected to retire.\n\nHis exit undoubtedly leaves a hole at the heart of U.S. counternarcotics efforts abroad, particularly when drug addiction and overdose deaths in the United States are a full-blown crisis.\n\n“If only I had timed my departure to be five years ago,” he said in an interview last week at the State Department, where he leads the agency’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.\n\n“We were justifiably proud of what we’d accomplished in 2012,” he said. “That’s not the case now.”\n\nIn 2012, U.S. cocaine consumption and the size of the illegal coca crop in Colombia were near a low point, and much of the praise in Washington went to those responsible for designing and implementing Plan Colombia. Among them was Brownfield, who served as U.S. ambassador in Bogota from 2007 to 2010.\n\nSince then, Colombian farmers have been stuffing their fields with record amounts of illegal coca, coerced by trafficking groups or to qualify for cash handouts offered under crop-substitution programs linked to the government’s peace deal with leftist guerrillas. Colombia’s cocaine production ballooned to 710 metric tons last year, according to U.S. estimates, up from 235 metric tons in 2013.\n\nBrownfield also blames Colombia’s 2015 decision to ban aerial spraying of illegal coca. U.S.-funded crop dusters were a pillar of Plan Colombia, but the herbicides are suspected of causing cancer.\n\nThe cocaine surge is fraying the U.S.-Colombia partnership that Brownfield worked so long to help build. Last week, Trump took the extraordinary step of threatening to blacklist Colombia as nation that has “failed demonstrably” to meet its commitments as a partner in the drug war.\n\nThe mere idea of such a designation was unthinkable just a few years ago, and it would put Washington’s closest ally in Latin America in the company of Venezuela and Bolivia, nations whose relations with the United States are adversarial.\n\n“For the past year, in our private discussions, both Colombia and the United States have emphasized the importance of drugs not becoming a negative element in the bilateral relationship between two friends,” Brownfield said. The president’s statement, he added, “reemphasizes that importance.”\n\nColombia’s drug-production relapse has clearly weighed on Brownfield, and he said whoever succeeds him will have to cope with both a flood of methamphetamine and opioid trafficking from Mexico as well as the latest new surge of South American cocaine.\n\nBrownfield nonetheless insists that Latin America has changed for the better since he joined the Foreign Service, with an expanding middle class and democratic governance the norm. “When I started, there were only four nonmilitary governments in the region,” he said. “I can say emphatically it’s a far better region today.”\n\nBrownfield grew up in Brownfield, Tex., a ranching and cotton-farming town founded by his ancestors southwest of Lubbock. When his great-grandfather divided up his 64,000-acre ranch among five heirs, Brownfield’s grandfather was the only one whose land wasn’t sitting on commercial quantities of oil and gas. “Today I have a lot of happy cousins,” he said.\n\nBrownfield’s father joined the U.S. Army in 1939, retiring as a brigadier general nearly 30 years later. His brother was also a career military officer.\n\nBrownfield took the Foreign Service exam as a law student at the University of Texas, mostly he said, “because it was free.”\n\nHe asked to be sent to the Middle East after Foreign Service school but was assigned to Georgetown, Guyana. It was just after the Jonestown massacre, and as a junior vice consul, Brownfield would have helped with the job of repatriating the remains of hundreds of the Rev. Jim Jones’s followers.\n\nPleading for another posting, he was offered Maracaibo, the capital of Venezuela’s oil industry. He immediately accepted, assuming it was somewhere in North Africa. “I had to rush down to the library to find it on a map,” he said.\n\nBrownfield returned to Venezuela as U.S. ambassador from 2004 to 2007 and made a point of visiting pro-Chávez neighborhoods while promoting “baseball diplomacy” between the two nations. Chávez cast him as a meddlesome imperialist, and Brownfield said he woke up in a hotel once and learned from CNN that Chávez had threatened the night before to kick him out of the country. It wouldn’t be the last time.\n\nBrownfield calls those years his most miserable in the Foreign Service, when he once had to outrun a stone-throwing mob. Chávez publicly celebrated Brownfields’s departure with chants of “Oooh Ahhh Brownfield is Leaving!” At the end of his tour, Brownfield showed up at an embassy party wearing a T-shirt with the phrase printed on it.\n\nHe still keeps a large Chávez bobblehead doll on a bookshelf. On one side of the doll is a statue of a rifle-toting Colombian soldier. On the other, an Arizona ranger. They’ve got him surrounded.\n\n“Bill’s an original,” said Bernard Aronson, the former U.S. special envoy to the Colombia peace talks, who was Brownfield’s boss in the early 1990s. “He can give a speech that a stand-up comedian could give, but buried behind his wry humor and jokes, there’s substance in it. And I’ve never seen anyone put him in a partisan bind, which is a rare thing. It’s a real loss for State,” he said.\n\nColleagues say Brownfield has been particularly skilled at using humor to set up a tough message.\n\n“He comes off as this odd guy who is irreverent and sarcastic, but he’s really direct in dealing with people,” said Roberta Jacobson, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico. “There are very few people I’ve learned as much from.”","author":"Nick Miroff, Nick Miroff","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-09-17T13:37:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/09/16/Others/Images/2017-09-15/AP_17214540697991.JPG?t=20170517","digest":"kbKFKWQD0LS+ljV0saDOcg==\n"}
